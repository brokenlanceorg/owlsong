SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) - Hope is building Kroger Co. can signal a turnaround for the slumping U.S. supermarket sector when the No. 1 U.S. grocery chain issues earnings next Tuesday.

So far this month, Kroger

Other supermarket chains are gaining too. Supervalu

"We anticipate that Kroger will show leadership in slowly unwinding the excessive pricing and promotions that have put the supermarket industry in the doldrums," BB&amp;T analyst Andy Wolf said Friday in a research note.

He is advising investors to buy shares of Kroger and Safeway as he believes the supermarket sector is reaching the point where price wars will ease. 


								</p>
								<p>
Supermarket chains could use a break from a brutal price war that began 18 months ago. It's hammered margins and depressed same-store sales growth. 


								</p>
								<p>
Cutting shelf prices has also been costly. In Kroger's case, its supermarket selling gross margin fell 109 basis points in the quarter ended November 2009, 126 points the following quarter, and 71 points in the recent May ended period. 


								</p>
								<p>
For its fiscal second-quarter, Kroger is forecast to earn 36 cents a share, down from 39 cents in last year's same  period, according to a Sept. 10 FactSet analyst survey. Sales are expected to be up 5.4% to $18.7 billion, with same-store sales growth of 2.4%. 


								</p>
								<p>
There are sources of investor optimism for a rebound in the supermarket sector.


								</p>
								<p>
Wal-Mart Stores is backing off aggressive short-term grocery price cuts, irrational promotions among grocery chains are easing, and brand-name packaged food makers are expected to bear most of the cost to discount their products, industry observers say.


								</p>
								<p>
U.S. supermarket chains have frustrated investors. Last October, investors poured money into grocery-chain shares in hopes food inflation would stabilize sales and ease price wars. That didn't pan out and supermarket shares were sold off last December.


								</p>
								<p>
The sector was hit again when Wal-Mart cut grocery prices in the spring. More recently, Safeway, Supervalu, and Food Lion, owned by Belgium's Delhaize Group

Kroger is widely-favored by analysts, who on average, think the stock is worth $24.32 a share based on their fiscal 2011 profit targets. Ten analysts rate the stock a buy, three rate it a hold, and two rate it a sell, according to FactSet Research.


								</p>
								<p>
Ajay Jain, analyst at Hapoalim Securities, isn't so sure. He rates Kroger a sell. Jain doubts Kroger will see much upside to its gross margin unless it jacks prices.


								</p>
								<p>
"We think it is highly unlikely that management would choose to raise prices in a broad-based context," Jain said in a research note Friday.


								</p>
								<p>
And a positive outlook from Kroger next week, while helpful, may not be enough to lift all sails. Supervalu whose chains include Albertsons and Sav-A-Lot, is still trying to overhaul its sales strategy after it was caught off-guard by the economic downturn.
