            Other attempts to define emergence are the following: the properties B are said to be emergent if and only if they can 
            not be predicted from a knowledge of the supervenient properties A. Or equivalently, the properties B are emergent if 
            and only if they are not reducible to the interactions of lower-level properties A. 
         </p>
         <p>
            There is a subtle problem with these definitions, and hence the quandary within which all of the philosophers have stagnated. 
            These definitions use such terms and concepts as ‘predicted’, ‘knowledge’, or ‘reducible’. These concepts tacitly assume 
            a <i>description</I> or <I>model</I> of reality because when one uses the term ‘predict’, there is an underlying theoretical 
            model that does the prediction! These definitions will be seen as the source of many problems shortly.
         </p>
         <p>
            Suppose that our definitions given above are correct. How would one begin to validate that emergent properties exist or 
            that emergent properties do not exist? Obviously, the tried and true scientific method should be employed to construct a hypothesis, 
            build a theoretical model, and compare predictions of the theory with reality to ascertain whether there is a match. 
            Suppose further that cognitive science has, what science believes to be, a finitely complete theoretical model of consciousness. 
            Thus, consciousness can be reductively explained within the framework of the theory. This theory, call it C-theory, rests within 
            the domain of cognitive science, and cognitive science is derived from biology, which is derived from chemistry, which is derived 
            from physics, whose underlying framework is mathematics.

            Furthermore, all of mathematics can essentially be derived from the 
            <a href="BWZF.htm" target="Main"><span class=linkTextWhite>Zermelo-Fraenkel (ZF)</span></a> system of axioms together with logic. 
            Thus, C-theory can be derived from the ZF formal system, or equivalently, C-theory is supervenient on the ZF formal system.

            It was in 1930, that a 24 year-old Austrian named Kurt G&#246del proved his famous Incompleteness Theorems. These theorems proved 
            two fundamental properties: 1) <I>any</I> formal system complex enough (i.e., rich enough to embody the natural numbers), will <I>always</I> 
            contain an infinite number of undecidable propositions; and 2) <I>no</I> formal system will be able to prove its consistency. 
            This means that there are possibly ‘true’ statements that can be formulated within the context of a formal system, but they 
            can not be proved true within the context of the formal system. Another devastating consequence is that a discipline such as 
            mathematics can not prove its own consistency-G&#246del actually showed that any formal system can prove its consistency 
            if and only if it is inconsistent. 
         </p>
         <p>
            What does this have to do with the present discussion? Observe that our C-theory is supervenient on the ZF formal system. 
            It should be obvious that the ZF formal system is subject to the Incompleteness Theorems, which implies that there will always be 
            undecidable propositions within the ZF formal system, and hence within the C-theory. In the context of C-theory, these 
            ‘undecidable propositions’ will <I>appear</I> as emergent properties because they can not be reductively explained 
            within C-theory. It is now clear why the terms ‘prediction’ and ‘reduction’ had to be eliminated from the definition 
            of emergence.
