            Now that the hardware is in place, the software, in the form of 
            <a href="neural/BWNeural1.htm" target="Main"><span class=linkTextWhite>artificial neural networks</span></a> 
            mapped out by the nanobots, will be able to give life to the first artificially intelligent beings.  
         </p>
         <p>
            <a href="http://www.a-i.com" target="_top"><span class=linkTextWhite>These beings</span></a> will act and live as if 
            they are fully conscious, and in the opinion of most cognitive scientists, they will be. 
         </p>
         <p>
            Consider the following thought experiment: each day replace a small portion of your biological brain with a non-biological 
            chip that functions in the exact same manner as the biological counterpart. Each day you feel no different because the new chip 
            functions exactly the same as the biological piece it replaced. 
         </p>
         <p>
            At the end of the process, you’re completely artificial, if I may 
            use the term, but you’re the same person as before because the pattern of connections in your brain is unequivocally identical. 
            This replacement process is logically equivalent to the process carried out by the nanobots. In actuality, this replacement process 
            is happening to our bodies constantly. Our cells are continually dying off, and others growing into their places. Not only is 
            this replacement procedure happening at the cellular level, it happens also at the atomic and quantum levels as well. 
         </p>
         <p>
            The salient feature that makes us who we are is the pattern of connections between the neurons in our brains. And this pattern 
            can be easily written to storage once it exists on computer. 
         </p>
         <p>
            Now, back to the A.I. beings. These beings will be vastly more intelligent than are we. As stated, by 2059, the most basic 
            computer will have the computing power of an entire race of humans--these machines will be the substrate on which these beings 
            will think. 
         </p>

         <p>
            These beings will be self-modifying and self-replicating--taking the evolutionary exponential growth to the 
            veritable stratosphere. A single AI entity will be able to outthink all of the world’s greatest mathematicians and scientists, 
            which brings up the next point: Human adaptation. 
         </p>
         <p>
            It will be necessary for humans to modify themselves to keep up with the evolution of the A.I. beings, otherwise, 
            the alternative is to linger behind on a planet that will be swallowed by the Sun’s capacious corona when it goes nova. 
         </p>
         <p>
            We will be able to supplant our biological brains with artificial neural nets and nanobots enhancing cognitive abilities. 
         </p>
         <p>
            (By the way, scientists have already integrated non-biological neural nets with biological ones. San Diego’s Institute for 
            Nonlinear Science connected the neural net of a spiney lobster with an artificial non-biological neural net. 
            The biological net functioned perfectly in symbiosis with the non-biological net. Others such as Berger at Headco Neruosciences 
            and Mead at Cal tech are performing similar such feats.)
         </p>
         <p>
            With the help of nanobots, as alluded to above, humans will be able 
            to save their brain patterns in mind files. These files will capture every neural connection to storage so that the person 
            may exist indefinitely if one so chooses (provided the proper hardware exists to instantiate the mind file). 
         </p>
         <p>
            With respect to 
            mind files, security issues and software viruses will take on a level of importance that can’t be overstated. Thus it will be necessary 
            for one to make backups of one’s self regularly.
