         These results are in accordance with <a href="BWQuantum.htm" target="Main"><span class=linkTextWhite>Quantum Physics</span></a> 
         whose venerated Principle of Uncertainty shows that there are vast tracts of information
         about the universe that can never be known--regardless of the methodology, there is no way in principle that the quandary can be avoided.
         </p>
         <p>
         Also demonstrated is the hallmark of mathematics: a result (that no being will ever know all there is about the universe) is proved in two
         disparate fields (Quatum Physics and Algorithmic Information Theory) through the application of mathematical logic. What other discipline
         or endeavor can publish such claims of utility?

         There are indeed other implications of this formulation of the Berry paradox. Consider now the following.
         </p>
         <p>
         The Berry Paradox may be restated as: "The least integer not nameable in less than or equal to a billion words." But why stop at a billion? 
         How about 200,000 words (roughly, the number of words in a book in front of me). We then have: "The least integer not nameable in fewer than 
         or equal to 200,000 words." In other words, this is the least number that can't be named in less than a book-sized description. 
         Of course, if this discription gives a number, then a contradiction has just occured because the number was named in less than 200,000 words.
         Since this number of words (200,000) is very manageable by a computer, a program can be written to implement the statement.
         </p>

         A program, call it Berrydox, could be written that would perform the following steps:<br><br>
         (1) Set the variable book_length = 200,000<br>
         (2) List out all possible sentences equal to or less than book_length (see step 1) words long.<br>
         (3) Sequentially iterate through the list, and for each entry, print out the number, if any, that the sentence names.<br>
         (4) Once this finite procedure terminates, print the first number not on the list.<br>
         </p>
         <p>
         Obviously, from the last result, this program can never terminate otherwise a contradiction would occur--only if Berrydox can be coded in
         <i>less than or equal to</i> 200,000 words. If Berrydox requires say 300,000 words to program, then in step (1) set book_length = 300,000.
         More generally, if Berrydox requires X number of words to program, then set book_length = X. This is done because if Berrydox is longer than
         200,000 words long, and if Berrdox completes execution with a number printed out on the screen, it has named a number in <i>more</i>
         than 200,000 words because the Berrydox program is longer than 200,000 words.
         </p>
         <p>
         Since Berrydox is a program that can be executed on a UTM, it is subject to the halting problem spoken of earlier. There are two cases: either
         Berrydox runs in an infinite loop, or it completes execution and prints a number on the screen. For the latter case, if Berrydox can be specified
         in less than or equal to 200,000 words, it has contradicted itself by printing out a number.
