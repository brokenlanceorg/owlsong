            Since the Book of Mormon holds that prophets exist today, 
            and the Bible holds that there can be no more prophets because Christ was the last, the two are contradictory and can’t be true 
            simultaneously. Thus, the mormon religion is contradictory, and therefore false. 
         </p>
         <p>
            After the “great” prophet Smith, came the “second greatest prophet” Bringham Young, whose inspirational speeches are still 
            maintained as scripture by the mormon church in Salt Lake City. A pathetic example of his brilliance shines in the following 
            disgusting passage: "Shall I tell you the law of God in regard to the African race? If the white man who belongs to the 
            chosen seed mixes his blood with the seed of Cain, the penalty, under the law of God, is death on the spot. This will 
            always be so." (B. Young, Journal of Discourses, Vol. 10, 110) And note that the ‘prophet’ Young has said: “Let me have 
            the privilege of correcting a sermon, and it is as good as scripture as they deserve.” (B. Young, Journal of Discourses, 
            Vol. 13, 95 ) Suppose God in fact communicated with Young and told him this disturbing piece of enlightenment, 
            why would God have racist views of his own creations? Worse still, why would God, later in 1978, decide that members of the 
            African race are now welcome in the cult? Did God’s perfect and eternal doctrine need a correction? There are literally 
            countless other disturbing beliefs in the mormon cult. I won’t insult the intelligence of the audience and perambulate 
            these squalid and feculent beliefs.

            The Baptist faith is not without it’s shameful and fallacious logic.

         <p>
            For example, consider the definition of God presented 
            earlier (and note also the use of the masculine and anthropomorphic possessive pronoun ‘his’): “There is one and only one 
            living and true God. He is an intelligent, spiritual, and personal Being, the Creator, Redeemer, Preserver, and Ruler 
            of the universe. God is infinite in holiness and all other perfections. God is all powerful and all knowing; and His 
            perfect knowledge extends to all things, past, present, and future, including the future decisions of His free creatures.” 
         </p>
         <p>
            The definition states that God is omniscient and his creatures have free will. This is completely impossible. 
            A being having free will means that no other entity knows or causes that being’s actions, thoughts, etc. Free will implies 
            that only I know and control what I’m going to do today, and more importantly that no other being knows or controls what 
            I’m going to do today, thus God is not omniscient, but by the Baptist’s definition God is omniscient-a logical contradiction, 
            therefore an impossibility.  
         </p>
         <p>
            To get around the contradiction temporarily one could continue to assume that God is omniscient 
            and omnipotent, but that he placed barriers that prevent us from becoming omniscient theoretically (i.e., quantum uncertainty ) 
            and thereby create the illusion that we have free will, although everything may still be determined precisely outside the 
            quantum system. In this scenario, there are those of God’s creations that will go to hell, and those that go to heaven.
