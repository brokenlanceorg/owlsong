         What is a proof? What does it mean to have <i>proved</i> something? Within a formal axiomatic system, statements or propositions can be
         formulated, and these propositions' veracity can generally be evaluated through a rigorous logical deduction. There are, however, 
         <i>undecidable</I> propositions that can exist in any formal system rich enough to embody the natural numbers, and hence the 
         use of the adjective 'generally'. It was the Austrian Kurt G&#246del who proved this in 1931 with his celebrated incompleteness 
         theorems. G&#246del's theorems will be dealt with more completely later.
         </p>
         <p>
         G&#246del used the might of mathematical logic to prove his theorems. It is as Oliver Heaviside said: <i>"Logic is invincible because
         one must use logic to defeat logic."</i> The logical proof of mathematics is the most certainty one can have about anything in the 
         universe. Logic is what we use everyday, logic is what has kept homo sapiens extant, logic is what we use to create everything including
         the computer screen from which you read these words. Logic is the very fabric on which the Spiritus Mundi is written. Logic tells us
         that if its raining outside, and one walks outside uncovered, one will get wet. Logic tells us if one were to jump, without any saftey 
         equipment, out of an airplane flying at 30,000 feet one will get <i>severely</i> injured.
         </p>
         <p>
         A proof is an affirmative restatement of an undeniable logical argument that anyone at anytime and anyplace in the universe can 
         understand. Proofs or theorems take use of this inveterate logic to show indubitably that the proposition at hand is true. Within the
         context of the formal axiomatic system, these theorems are used to prove other propositions, and so on ad infinitum.

         For example, consider the proof of the proposition that the 
         <a href="BWSqrtTwo.htm" target="Main"><span class=linkTextWhite>square root of two is irrational</span></a>.
         There are a couple of interesting points to note about this proof: (1) the proof is existential and (2) the proof uses the method of
         <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>. The term 'existential' means that the theorem shows that an object <i>exists</i> but it doesn't show 
         <i>how</i> to construct the said object. These kind of proofs display the power of mathematics. When the construction of an entity is
         difficult, if not impossible, an indirect method may be taken to show that the object exists without actually constructing the entity.
         The Pythagoreans used <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> (reduction to absurdity) to prove the proposition. This method works as follows:
         for a given <i>bivalent</i> proposition, say p, assume that its negation is true, i.e., assume that ~p is true. The mandate that the 
         proposition p is bivalent guarantees that the method of reductio ad absurdum works because if the proposition p had varying degrees of
         truthhood, the method would not work (as will be seen shortly); the assumption that the underlying logic is Aristotelian or Boolean implicitly
         guarantees that the proposition p is bivalent. Once the proposition ~p is formed, follow the resulting conclusions to show that ~p leads
         to a contradiction. When ~p is shown to lead to contradictions (i.e., ~p is true thus p is false), and since p can either be true or false,
         it must be the case that ~p is false or equivalently that p is true, and thus the proposition p is shown to be true.
         </p>
         <p>
         If the underlying logic was fuzzy or multivalent, the method would not work. For example, suppose we showed that ~p lead to contradictions,
         it would not necessarily follow that p is true, it would simply imply that ~p is not true--we could deduce nothing further.
