         Most days in the backwoods are similar to that disgusting scene--some days were worse, some days were better--but as I told myself: 
         a bad day in an educated city is better than a good day in the hills, and I vowed to leave when I got the chance.
         I can still recall being told God was going to punish me and my friends because we were ‘long-hairs’, but we could cut our hair; what about my 
         African American or Hispanic friends, or my 
         <a href="http://jaybenham.homestead.com" target="_top"><span class=linkTextWhite>Native American father</span></a> and family? Could they change their skin color?

         I attended a Christian school from my pre-school years through my seventh grade year. Even by age nine, I began to see something 
         wrong with the church/school’s logic. I was well-versed in astronomy (for a nine year old); I knew all of the planets, what their 
         respective atmospheres were made of, how far they were from the Earth, how long it took them to revolve around the sun, etc. I was 
         well aware that our solar system was but one in about a billion in the galaxy, and that our sun was but one star in about 400 billion 
         in the galaxy. Thus, when my Christian teacher told us that since the planets were about to line up in their orbits about the sun (1981) 
         God was going to come back to Earth, I found it very troublesome. I thought to myself: does the aligning of the planets cause God to return? 
         Or does this event just presage Jesus’ return? But I also knew that the Bible said that no one will know when Jesus will return. 
         Where was the logic in all of this? I couldn’t find it.

         As I got older, the conundrums became worse. Those who asked questions (real questions) about the Bible, were labeled as ‘trouble-makers’ 
         and set apart from the others. Our church, and every other church that I knew about, was intolerant of non-Caucasians. When I realized 
         that only Caucasians were fully accepted into the church, I knew I had to get out (I was twelve years old). 
         The last straw was placed when I was told that if I were to attend a public school, I would contract AIDS and become a drug addict. 
         It was at that point, that I realized I was involved in a cult, and it was high time to get out. Could you imagine saying something 
         like that to a twelve or thirteen year old child? Worse yet, what would you do if someone said something like that to *your* child?

         The first <a href="BWZeppelin.htm" target="Main"><span class=linkTextWhite>Zeppelin</span></a> song I ever heard was ‘Ramble On’. 
         What a great song: <I>”Leaves are falling all around, time I was on my way. 
         Thanks to you I’m much obliged for such a pleasant stay. But now it’s time for me to go, the autumn moon lights my way….”</I> 
         It was through my friend’s parents that I learned this song was based on J.R.R. Tolkien’s masterpiece trilogy 
         <a href="http://www.glyphweb.com/arda/default.htm" target="_top"><span class=linkTextWhite>‘The Lord of the Rings’</span></a>. 
         I read the trilogy, together with ‘The Hobbit’, in about a week. I was hooked. I couldn’t believe how simple words could have such power. 
         It seems amazing to me that authors arrange symbols in a particular order such that it has 
         <a href="BWConst.htm" target="Main"><span class=linkTextWhite>meaning</span></a> to humans.
