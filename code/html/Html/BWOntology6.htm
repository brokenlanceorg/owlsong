            As has been stated, Godel showed that there exist unprovable statements within a formal system, such as the 
            <a href="BWZF.htm" target="Main"><span class=linkTextWhite>Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms,</span></a> 
            or the ZF system together with the axiom of choice, or more specifically, any formal system rich enough to capture the 
            model of the natural numbers. Could the proposition: ‘God exists’ be such an unprovable statement? If the statement and associated 
            definitions are ensconced in an appropriate formal system, then yes it’s possible. 
         </p>
         <p>
            The idea that a proof of God’s existence or 
            non-existence is unprovable is not new. Consider the words of Pope John Paul II: “Science must recognize its limits and its 
            inability to reach the existence of God: it can neither affirm nor deny his existence.” It’s quite easy to show that God 
            could not exist within this universe. I have 
            <a href="BWEpistemology.htm" target="Main"><span class=linkTextWhite>shown,</span></a> that it is impossible for anything, be it man, machine, 
            or matter incarnate, to have infinite knowledge of the universe, which means that a God-like entity could not exist in physical 
            form within our universe; thus scientific proof of such an entity is impossible. This fact doesn’t imply that God doesn’t exist, 
            only that it couldn’t appear in physical form within the confines of the physical universe. It does show however, that a 
            proof of God’s existence, in the school of logical-positivism, is impossible.  So it seems that the Pope is correct to claim 
            that God’s existence can’t be proved either way. 
         </p>
         <p>
            However, a curious and subtle quality arises when a well-formed statement is proved to be unprovable. To see this, consider the 
            following proposition: “there exists a perfect odd number.” (A perfect number is a number such that it’s divisors, excluding 
            itself, sum to that number.)  
         </p>
         <p>
         </p>
      </div>
      </td>

	<td bgcolor=#222222 valign=top width=50%>
      <div class=bodyWhiteSmallJustify>
         <p>
            To this day, the only known perfect numbers are even numbers. But, suppose someone makes the 
            positive claim that a perfect odd number exists, and they present some numbers that they believe to be perfect, but analysis 
            shows that they are in fact not perfect. Then suppose it is shown that the proposition is unprovable, i.e., that you can’t 
            prove if there are or aren’t perfect odd natural numbers. Once the proposition is shown to be unprovable, it logically follows 
            that there are no perfect odd numbers. This is true since the proposition is unprovable, no one will ever find a perfect odd 
            number to prove that it is true, and since no perfect odd has ever been found it can be inferred that there really are no perfect 
            odd numbers-even in the meta-formal system.
         </p>
         <p>
            Now that it’s been shown that it’s impossible to prove or disprove God’s existence, it naturally follows that God does not exist. 
            Just as in the case of perfect odd numbers, since God has not been proven to exist in the past, and since proof of God’s 
            existence is physically impossible, the physical proof of God’s existence will never appear. Thus, God doesn’t exist. 
            Just as in the case of perfect odd numbers not existing in the meta-formal system, God doesn’t exist metaphysically. 
         </p>
         <p>
            Note that although this proof shows that God, as previously defined, doesn’t exist, it doesn’t prove that a metaphysical 
            creator doesn’t exist. 
         </p>
         <p>
            Notice that the above politic argument could hold for any claim so long as it’s been proven unprovable. For example, 
            suppose I claim that pink elephants are created every time I sneeze. If it can be shown that my claim is unprovable, 
            then it quickly follows that my claim is false.
