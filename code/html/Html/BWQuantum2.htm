           The problem is that kT doesn't cancel, or mitigate, the 
           <span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">n</span></span><sup>2</sup> term in the expression
           for 
           N(<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">n</span></span>)d<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">n</span></span>. 
           Thus, as <span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">n</span></span> approaches infinity, 
           N(<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">n</span></span>)d<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">n</span></span> 
           * kT (equivalently, the energy in the
           range <span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">n</span></span> to <span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">n</span></span> + 
           d<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">n</span></span>) approaches infinity! This result was completely unacceptable.
         </p>
         <p>
           A paper published in the <i>Annalen Der Physik</i> (1900) by the physicist Max Plank at the
           University of Berlin resolved this quandary by assuming that the energy of an oscillator
           is restricted to certain multiples of its frequency, namely, E<sub>n</sub> = nh<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">n</span></span>, 
           where n is a positive integer and h is a constant.
         </p>
         <p>
           Plugging this result back into the former calculations, we find that the integral for the 
           average energy of a particle is no longer an integral, but rather a summation since the
           energy levels are no longer a continuum but a discrete set. This summation turns out to
           contain a fraction which has an exponential of the frequency in the denominator.

         <p>
           And, as any mathematics student knows, the exponential will 'overtake' the 
           <span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">n</span></span><sup>2</sup> 
           term
           in N(<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">n</span></span>)d<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">n</span></span> 
           for large <span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">n</span></span>.
         </p>
         <p>
           This new result for the energy agreed <i>perfectly</i> with experiment, and thus the quantum theory was born.
         </p>
         <p>
           Little came of this new quantum theory for the next five years until, in 1905, Einstein used
           the quantum assumption to explain the photoelectric effect. The photoelectric effect was the
           phenomenon in which electrons were ejected when light was cast on a metal foil. So, it seemed
           that light was acting as billiard balls, with energy E = h<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">n</span></span>, 
           knocking the electrons out. However, up to that point, most physicists had putatively agreed that light was a wave.
         </p>
         <p>
           Young's famous double slit experiment demonstrated light's wave-like behavior, yet with 
           Einstein's result, light appeared to act as particles. The strange thing about all this
           is that light behaves differently depending on <i>how</i> we look at the light.
