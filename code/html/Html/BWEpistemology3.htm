         Consider now the program R: 
         </p>
         <pre>"Print out the number that is<br>not the length of the<br>most elegant program as short<br>as this program."</pre>
         <p>
         This program is essentially a variation on the theme of the Berry Paradox. G. G. Berry was a librarian who communicated the paradox to Bertrand
         Russell while the latter was constructing his <i>Principia Mathematica</i>. The paradox is as follows: "The least integer not nameable in fewer
         than nineteen syllables". However, we have just named that integer in <i>eighteen</i> syllables, therefore a contradiction.
         </p>
         <p>
         Looking back at the program above (call it program R), we see that the output is a number which is not the length of some program P, 
         but this program P's length may be less than or equal to the length of program R. How can this be? That is to say, how can a program 
         of length less than or equal to some finite number (the length of the above program R) not have a length?
         </p>
         <p>
         The semantics of the program R are basically the following steps in an algorithm:<br>
         (1) Calculate the length of self ( n = length(R) )<br>
         (2) Form all possible programs of length n and execute each one<br>
         (3) If output from the program equals n, then place program in set S<br>
         (4) When all finitely many programs have been executed, form set 
         T = {length(s):s <span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#206</span></span>S}<br>
         (5) Print the first number that is not in the set T<br>
         </p>

         <p>
         But we know <i>a priori</i> that step (5) can never terminate, otherwise a contradiciton would occur. This is because if step (5) prints a number,
         the program is essentially saying that this number is not the length of the most elegant program as short as this program, but it just printed 
         a number saying otherwise!
         </p>
         <p>
         Looking at this result, we see that this is yet a manifestation of the Liar Paradox, or Epimenides Paradox which states:
         </p>
         <pre>"This sentence is not true."</pre> <p>Thus, if the sentence as a whole is true, then what it says is true--but it says that itself is 
         not true. Moreover, if the sentence as a whole is false, then looking at what it says: "This sentence is not true" implies that what it 
         says about itself <i>is</i> correct thereby making the sentence true contrary to the assumption that it is false.
         </p>
         <p>
         The logician Kurt G&#246del said that this is one of the paradoxes that spurred his creation of his celebrated Incompleteness Theorems.
         </p>
         <p>
         Now looking back at our program's steps, we know that something must be wrong. The problem is step (2); during this step, all programs of length(R)
         will be composed and executed. But, the program R is in that set! This means that program R, in step (2), will compose itself and execute itself,
         which means the new version will compose R and execute R, which means this new version will compose R and execute R, which means...and so on ad
         infinitum.
