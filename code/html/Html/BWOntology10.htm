            The salubrious benefits of a mind file are indeed multifarious. For example, 
            information will be much easier to share when persons exist as mind files. If I want to acquire the information contained in the 
            national library, I simply download and integrate the connection file and I’ve acquired the knowledge.

            Eventually, most people will exist primarily in cyberspace as abstract 
            <a href="neural/BWNeural1.htm" target="Main"><span class=linkTextWhite>artificial neural networks</span></a>--be they adapted humans or A.I. beings. 
            In the future’s version of the Internet, the universe will be at your finger-tips, or at your neural tips as the case may be. 
            One will be able to spawn a body as needed, take any form required, as provided by the software virtual reality. So long as the 
            hardware supports your software format, one could exist indefinitely in cyberspace.

            These few features of the future that I have sketched above are truly only a paucity of the most salient technologies that will 
            appear in the next century. Imagine what will come about in 500 years time? Or a thousand years, or even a million years hence? 
            Needless to say, evolution will mandate that we, and/or our progeny, will colonize first the Milky Way, then other galaxies, 
            and in the process, harness enough energy to appear god-like to the present day intellect.

            Imagine hundreds of years from now when incorporating an ancient text titled “the Bible” into its mind file, our super-intelligent 
            scion will nearly instantly grasp every nuance of the book including passages such as: 
         </p>
         <p>
            “Let the women keep silent in the churches; 
            for they are not permitted to speak,…And if they desire to learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at home; for it is 
            improper for a women to speak in church”. 
         </p>
         <p>
            Since we know what its intellectual response will be, the question now becomes: 
            ‘will its emotional response be an amusing laugh, or will it let go an ululated cry?’
