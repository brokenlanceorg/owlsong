           Ostensibly, the branch of knowledge known as 'Physics' is the study of the interaction
           of energy. We (humankind) have discovered from specializations such as high-energy particle
           physics that everything is ultimately energy including ordinary matter such as neutrons, 
           protons, etc., and even the elusive dark matter is ultimately energy. Thus physics serves
           to observe these interactions of energy and fashion a coherent theory to explain the 
           phenomena of interaction and to both retrodict and predict the phenomena.

           There is, to be sure, more to physics than this prima facie definition betrays. Physics is
           the veritable foundation on which the whole of human knowledge is based. Without physics,
           there can be no higher branches of learning. Without physics and it's inviolable laws,
           chemistry would never have been refined to a science, bio-chemistry would never have led
           to a firm founding of biology, string theory would not have even been contemplated, nor
           <a href="BWQuantum.htm" target="Main"><span class=linkTextWhite>quantum mechanics</span></a>
           or loop quantum gravity theory. Science needs the paragon of physics
           as a template for those insipient pursuits such as cognitive science, neurophysiology,
           physiology, and psychology; zoology and neuroscience should aspire to the certitude 
           afforded by physic's stanchions--astrophysics and thermodynamics.
