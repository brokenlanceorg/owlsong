            But since God has pre-ordained everyone’s fate, God has sent some of his creations to burn in hell for eternity, again 
            violating the definition of God being infinite in holiness and all perfections. These pernicious contradictions are the 
            worst kind of logical error. Ambiguous thinking, unnecessary definitions, even gaps in reasoning requiring ‘faith’ is 
            acceptable to a degree, but a contradiction is the worst possible logical error.
         </p>
         <p>
            The standard response to all these contradictions is: “God works in mysterious ways”. This response is nothing more 
            than primitivism. It is this kind of atavistic thinker that would have done well in the ancient Mayan civilization when 
            human sacrifices were made to “appease the gods”. Let us suppose then that God works in mysterious ways, and further 
            that there is a supreme ‘God-logic’ up there in the sky that we will only come to know fully once we are inside the 
            pearly gates. Why then must God’s perfect religious doctrine have so many contradictions here on Earth, while mathematics 
            and science have no such error? Shouldn’t God-logic be contradiction-free here on Earth as it is in heaven? 
         </p>
         <p>
            Moreover, why would God fashion the universe to follow mathematical rules that allow us to live, but when it comes 
            to salvation, God requires one to believe in absurd contradictions. And for those that continue to hold fast to logic 
            (the same logic that gives us heat, food, cars, computers, medical equipment, etc.), God condemns to burn in hell? 
            Again, the argument gets <i>crushed</i> under the punishing weight of contradiction, because God is then no longer a God, 
            but nothing more than a sadist who enjoys watching it’s creatures languish in pain due to it’s duplicitous doctrine.

            All of these contradictions render the religious notion of ‘God’ untenable. Today, most religious leaders fall back to 
            the subterfuge that the existence of God is unprovable, while trying to sweep the contradictions of their doctrine under 
            the rug. Ignore then the plethora of extant contradictions in religious doctrine and explore the idea of provability.

            In 1931, a perspicacious logician by the name of Kurt Godel published a paper proving his celebrated Incompleteness theorems. 
            In essence, Godel’s results proved that any formal system contains unprovable statements, that is, one can produce well-formed 
            propositions within the confines of the axiomatic system, but be unable to prove them true or false regardless of the logical 
            artifice one uses. In this same paper, Godel also proved that a formal system can not be proved to be consistent from within 
            that formal system.

            As an example of his first incompleteness theorem, consider Goldbach’s conjecture. In a 1742 letter to Euler, 
            Christian Goldbach stated a simple proposition whose proof has eluded the greatest mathematicians for 250 years. In it’s modern 
            form, the conjecture holds that every even number can be written as the sum of two prime numbers. By the incompleteness theorem, 
            it’s possible that this statement can not be proved true or false. That is to say, every even number may be written as the sum 
            of two primes, but it can’t be proven thus. There are many results and nuances to Godel’s theorems, such as
