         What this implies is that in general, any program of length X can not 'understand' an exhaustive set of words of length X in any language.
         The word 'understand' is used here to mean simply the process of <i>translating</i> from language to number--the act of naming a number 
         with words. Since no program can turn a simple phrase into a number, it immediately follows that interpreting the vast richness of language 
         is impossible for a finite UTM.

         The consequences are even more profound if we continue reasoning. Suppose it is the case that the human in all of its raiments from behavior
         to consciousness, from emotion to intentions, and beyond is reducible to the actions of a UTM. Then by the demonstrations above it too is 
         subject to the halting problem and the result above, namely, that the human mind can not understand itself in an exhaustive way. This doesn't
         rule out the fact that the mind could understand itself to varying degrees of precision, but it does preclude a full and comprehensive 
         understanding of its own workings.
         </p>
         <p>
         Suppose then on the contrary that the human mind is not reducible to the actions of a finite UTM. In this case, the above results do not apply.
         However, this implies that consciousness, and the related phenomena, are <i>emergent</i> properties of brain <i>function</i>. In this holistic
         view of sentience, it too follows that the mind will never fully grasp its own workings, for to understand any part, an understanding
         of the whole must exist, but to understand the whole it must become more complex than the whole--at which point even more

         <a href="BWEmergence.htm" target="Main"><span class=linkTextWhite>Emergent properties</span></a> may not necessarily be as 
         mystical as they sound. Even though the emergent properties form when a certain configuration of
         matter and energy are manifest, the emergent properties are <i>dependent</i> upon that very configuration of matter and energy.

         For example, when two atoms of hydrogen are combined with an atom of oxygen, the result is a substance known to us as water, which goes 
         through two phase transitions at zero and one-hundred degrees. Could this fact be derived from knowledge of chemistry alone? What about 
         consciousness and emotion? What about <i>all</i> of the phenomena associated with sentience?
