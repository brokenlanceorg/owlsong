During the early 1940’s, cognitive scientists turned their attention upon a new model of brain functions introduced by Warren McCulloch and 
Walter Pitts. The model they developed was based on data resulting from leading scientists’ work in brain research, notably 
Cajal and Sherrington. A neural network consists of virtual neurons connected by virtual dendrites and axons just as real neurons are 
interconnected by dendrites and axons in nervous systems of living organisms, including both vertebrates and invertebrates. 
Typically, the neural network has an input layer to which data patterns are shown, and an output layer of neurons which 
contain the network’s response to the input pattern.

Prior to the widespread availability of the computer, implementation of these networks necessitated the hard-wiring of circuits, and clearly, 
this process was time-consuming and generally inefficient. In addition, several scientists produced results showing that the perceptron, 
(a precursor to today’s virtual neuron), was computationally weak; moreover, several theorems demonstrated that search algorithms of most 
neural networks could be hampered by local minima in the search space.

Naturally then, most scientists during the 1960’s and 1970’s 
deprecated these “connectionist” approaches to artificial intelligence and focused again upon symbolic artificial intelligence. 
However, due to recent advances in the computer industry, large, computationally intensive neural networks can be implemented easily in a 
robust programming language.
         </p>
         <p>
Given that the brain is highly parallel in structure, that is to say, several parts of a problem can be computed simultaneously, neural 
networks are now being implemented on computers with parallel architectures, thereby furthering the neural network’s success. 
New neural network architectures are being devised to exploit today’s fast parallel processors.
         </p>
         <p>
During the era of symbolic artificial intelligence, there were a plethora of problems which were not only unsolvable, but nearly unapproachable. 
For example, speech and visual recognition were unsolvable, but with the neural network, the solution is almost trivially easy. 
Other examples include memory models and knowledge generalization.
