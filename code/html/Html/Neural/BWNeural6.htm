The walls of the medium (axon or dendrite) are made of proteins which can function as membranous gates allowing certain ions through, 
while rejecting others. The medium can then modify its gates down its length, which causes certain ions to move in and others out, 
and consequently, and impulse to travel down its length. This process is indeed considerably slower than the metal wire scenario, 
however, due to this regenerative action down the length of the axon, the impulse spike is able to maintain its initial strength.

Most axons are several feet long, some can be up to ten feet or more in length<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190</span></span>how 
else would one twitch one’s toes! Research has 
shown that if the impulses incoming from the dendrites are above a certain threshold, then the neuron outputs an impulse down its axon, 
whereupon the impulse is received into other dendrites through synaptic clefts. The nature of this impulse down the axon is a property 
of brain function that interested Helmholtz; he began studying them in 1852. He discovered that the wider the axon, the faster the 
impulse signal could travel down its length. As an aside, some of the axons he studied in roaches were several magnitudes larger 
than any found in humans.

Helmholtz performed most of his experiments on what are known as unmyelinated axons; however, 
most axons found in humans are coated with a growth of cells called the myelin sheath. This sheath functions as an insulator, 
thereby improving the impulse’s speed by decreasing the pernicious effects of “loss of signal”. With 
<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">m</span></span> being a thousandth of a millimeter, 
typical axon widths range from .5<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">m</span></span> up to 
10<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">m</span></span>.
Helmholtz discovered that the average speed of these impulses was about five 
feet per second, which was drastically smaller in magnitude than what was previously 
held<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190</span></span>for it was putatively held that the 
impulses traveled at the speed of light.
         </p>
         <p>
Axons rarely attach directly to a neuron, rather, they attach to dendrites. This junction is known as the synaptic cleft. 
Similarly, the axon does not attach itself directly to the dendrite, but it is separated by the cleft’s distance of about 
.05<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">m</span></span>. When the 
impulse reaches the synaptic cleft, proteins called vesicles are released which trigger certain gates on the post-synaptic side 
(dendritic side), which allow the necessary ions to flow in or out.
