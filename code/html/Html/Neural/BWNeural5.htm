The first scientist to begin a thorough investigation was Camillo Golgi in 1870; 
and soon after, in Spain, Cajal developed some interesting theories, some of which still hold (on the functions of dendrites and 
axons in the cerebral cortex of the mammalian brain). The German physiologist and physicist, Herman Von Helmholtz (1821-1894) 
performed many crucial experiments on the nature of the electrical impulses that travel through the dendrites and axons.

In the 1940’s, Roger Sperry, the trustee professor emeritus of psychobiology at CIT, is famous for experimental studies of how 
brain circuits are formed, and his theories were placed on strong footing in the 1960’s and 1970’s when micro-electrode techniques 
were substantially improved which enabled the identification of inputs (dendrites) to single cells (neurons).

By the 1950’s, the function of the individual neuron was well-understood. The brain can be roughly divided into three parts: 
the paleocortex, which is the least evolved of the three sections due to the fact that this atavistic section is “inherited”, 
as it were, from our distant reptilian ancestors;

the archiocortex, or commonly known as the hippocampus; and the neocortex, 
or “new-cortex” for the most evolved section of the cerebral cortex.
         </p>
         <p>
Within the neocortex, there are several different types of neurons. The most common type is the “pyramidal” neuron, and 
the “spiny-stellate” neuron, and of these two, the pyramidal is by far the most common. They both derive their names from their physical structure.
         </p>
         <p>
The typical neuron has many hundreds to thousands of dendrites (usually 500-1500), which are a myriad of incoming “lines”, that 
carry the input impulse to the cell body, or equivalently, the neuron. The outgoing impulse (if there is one), from the neuron 
is carried away to the other dendrites by means of the axon. The impulses traveling through the dendrites and axons are not exactly 
“impulses” in the traditional current and wire scenario. The impulse in a metal wire, for instance, consists of a cloud of electrons 
traveling through the wire. However, an impulse traveling down an axon or dendrite is constituted of charged atoms, or ions.
