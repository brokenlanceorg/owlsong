The image below shows the evolution of the rule 254 starting from an initial single black cell (The image colors were reversed for viewing):

Wolfram exhaustively studied all 256 such rules and was able to delineate a classification scheme consisting of 4 classes of behavior. 
Class 1 systems are similar to rule 254 above in that they display only simple repetitive behavior. Class 2 systems display more 
complex behavior in that they exhibit nesting sequences that are the hallmark of 
<a href="../BWFractal.htm" target="Main"><span class=linkTextWhite>fractal sets.</span></a> 
Class 3 systems exhibit extremely 
chaotic, random-like behavior that is incompressible. And finally, Class 4 systems exhibit a mixture of Class 2 and 3.

Wolfram patented an algorithm that uses rule 30 to produce random numbers, in fact, this algorithm is the one used in 
the sophisticated <i>Mathematica</i> software package that Wolfram created. Rule 30 is a typical rule from the class 3 system; 
it displays enormous complexity that never repeats.

Wolfram’s most spectacular contribution, however, was his demonstration that the Rule 110 one dimensional cellular automata 
from the class 4 systems is a 
<a href="BWTuring1.htm" target="Main"><span class=linkTextWhite>Universal Turing Machine.</span></a>  
         </p>
         <p>
The first person to investigate the Universality of one-dimensional 
cellular automata was Alvy Ray Smith. In 1970, Smith created an 18-color nearest-neighbor cellular automaton capable of 
emulating Marvin Minsky’s 7-state, 4-color Universal Turing Machine. In 1994, Wolfram and Mathew Cook demonstrated the 
Universality of Rule 110. It was well known that a certain class of cyclic tag systems could emulate any Turing machine, 
since a Universal Turing Machine is itself a Turing machine, then that class of cyclic tag systems emulate a UTM.

         <p>
(Cyclic tag systems are similar to cellular automata in that they consist of cells on a grid. There are a set of rules that are 
cycled through with each step in the evolution of the system. For instance, say there are two sets of rules, then for each row, 
the first cell is pulled off. Based on the color of that cell, one or more black or white cells are added to the end of the row, or none at all. 
At the next row, the other set of rules is employed and so on, down the grid.)
         </p>
         <p>
Wolfram and Cook showed that the Rule 110 can be set up to emulate <i>any</i> cyclic tag system thereby demonstrating that the Rule 110 
is equivalent to a Universal Turing Machine. It is Wolfram’s conjecture that <i>all</i> cellular automata from class 4 systems are Universal.
