The general learning algorithm is as follows: first, a random unit is chosen, 
if any of its neighbors are active, it sums the weights on those active connections; if the sum is positive, the unit becomes active, 
otherwise it is inactive. Next, another random unit is chosen and the state of that unit is determined similarly. 
This process is continued until no units may change state; at this point, the network is said to have become stable, and this type 
of algorithm is known as “parallel relaxation”.

Hopfield proved that his network was completely deterministic and stable, that is, the problems of local minima do not arise 
in this context. The Hopfield network is another example of connectionist methods solving problems that symbolic artificial 
intelligence can not. In this instance, it is the problem of modeling associative memory. Some of the features of the Hopfield network include:
         </p>
         <ul>
         <li>
Distributed Representation: memories are stored as patterns of activations across a set of neuron units; moreover, memories 
may be stored on the same units-the memories are superimposed on one another.
         </li>
         </ul>

         <ul>
         <li>
Distributed Control: each unit makes decisions based only on its local situation, but the network, taken as a whole, 
models the overall memory pattern efficiently. This aspect of the Hopfield network is remarkably similar to the computing 
structures known as finite <a href="BWCellularAutomata1.htm" target="Main"><span class=linkTextWhite>cellular automata.</span></a>
         </li>
         <li>
Content-Addressable: to recall a particular pattern, or memory, only a portion of that memory is necessary to recall the 
whole pattern; this behavior is due to the network’s stability.
         </li>
         <li>
Fault-tolerance: if a few processing elements misfire, or fail completely, the surrounding neurons can adjust to recover the network’s integrity.
         </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
Another type of network called the Jordan network is an example of the recurrent network class. The characteristic feature of this 
class is the use of the network’s output in the next input instance, thus, there is no final state for which the network can be said to be stable. 
This special class is useful in time-dependent data sequences, such as the data which is fed to a robot’s sensors, or contextual 
language parsers.
