When in 1900 the eminent mathematician David Hilbert (1862-1943) presented his paper <i>“Mathematical Problems”</i> to the Second International 
Congress of Mathematicians, most present considered his enumerations as nothing more than novel curiosities, certainly not as imminent 
dilemmas vitiating the edifice of mathematics, as held by Hilbert. There were, however, many perspicacious mathematicians who understood 
the state of exigency that Hilbert’s twenty-three questions placed all of mathematics.
         </p>
         <p>
Prior to “Mathematical Problems”, Hilbert had been concerned with the consistency of geometry, and in his <u>Grundlagen der Geometrie</u> (1930) 
he showed that geometry was consistent if and only if arithmetic is consistent; naturally then, resolving the question of the consistency of 
arithmetic was tantamount to resolving the question of the consistency of geometry.

Most of the problems delineated in Hilbert’s paper have been completely solved, the most distinguishable of which was the second problem, 
the consistency of the system of mathematical analysis. In attempting to solve the problem of consistency, the logician/mathematician 
Kurt G&#246del (1906-1978) proved, in his paper <i>“On Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematica and Related Systems”</i>, 
that any formal system rich enough to model the natural numbers, whether the system is analysis, set theory, arithmetic, etc., 
is incomplete, meaning that there are, in fact, true theorems which can be phrased in the aforesaid formal system that can not be proven 
true in the formal system.

Arguably, Gödel’s metamathematical discovery has had a more profound impact than any other discovery in 
mathematics<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190</span></span>for such a metamathematical 
statement declares facts about human knowledge and epistemology; and it is clear that 
epistemology pervades any intellectual discipline however remote one may consider that discipline from mathematics.
