In the typical synapse, sodium ions (Na<sup>+</sup>) are kept on the 
outside of the dendrite, while potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) ions, which are less numerous than sodium ions, are kept on the inside of the dendrite. 
Thus, for the impulse to travel through the dendrite or axon, the protein gates open allowing (Na<sup>+</sup>) to flow inside the dendrite, 
while the (K<sup>+</sup>) flow outside. These gates operate in proper succession thus allowing the current of (Na<sup>+</sup>) to flow down the 
length of the medium. Once the gates allow the ions to flow through, the gates will revert to their previous function thereby restoring 
the original ion concentrations.

Impulses impinge on a neuron and affect it in one of three ways:
         </p>
         <ul>
         <li>
Excitation: if the impulse stimulates the neuron to firing its own impulse down its axon, the neuron can fire at a rate of 50-100 Hz, sometimes as much as 500 Hz.
         </li>
         <li>
Inhibition: the impulse may produce the reverse of stimulation, that is, inhibit the neuron’s normal functioning firing rate.
         </li>
         <li>
Modulation: the impulse can sometimes be seen to modulate the neuron’s response possibly to prevent feedback and other malignant affects.
         </li>
         </ul>

In 1943, Warren McCulluch (1899-1969) and Walter Pitts collaborated research interests to produce their famous paper, 
<i>“A Logical Calculus of the Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity”</i>, which introduced their idea of a formal model of the neuron as 
a threshold logic unit. One of the most salutary affects of the paper was the demonstration that any 
<a href="BWTuring1.htm" target="Main"><span class=linkTextWhite>Turing Machine</span></a> could be 
programmed to implement their neural network.
         </p>
         <p>
Building on McCulluch’s and Pitts’ success, Frank Rosenblatt, in his 1962 paper <i>“Principles of Neurodynamics”</i>, developed the perceptron. 
The perceptron is a discrete analogue of the modern day virtual neuron. The perceptron takes a weighted sum of its inputs, which are 
either zero or one, and outputs a one if the summed input is above a certain threshold, and zero otherwise. Since the inputs and 
outputs of the perceptron are only zeros or ones, the perceptron was developed for pattern recognition of black and white, or grayscale, 
patterns. Rosenblatt showed that whatever data sets, or patterns, the perceptron could model, it could “learn” to model them; this 
learning behavior was afforded by his “perceptron learning rule”, which was derived from his perceptron convergence theorem that 
stated any linearly separable data set could be modeled by a perceptron.
