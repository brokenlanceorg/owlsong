The thirteenth problem of <i>“Mathematical Problems”</i>, in the general sense, was concerned with the possibility of equating a function 
of any number of variables with a superposition of several, though finite, single variable functions. In particular, Hilbert had focused his 
attention on the seventh degree equation given by, 
         </p>

         <p>
where x, y, and z are constant. It was Hilbert’s cursory conjecture that (1) could not be written as a sum of single variable functions.

It was in 1957 that A.N. Kolmolgorov proved the converse of Hilbert’s claim in generality. The general form of Hilbert’s thirteenth problem 
takes the following form:

<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#204</span></span> N, with D being finite. V.I. Arnol’D proved earlier in 1957 that equation (2) hold for 
n = 3, and 1 <span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#163</span></span> k 
<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#163</span></span> 9.

In 1965, D.A. Sprecher generalized Kolmolgorov’s result. Other mathematicians and computer scientists, such as, Hecht-Nielson, Hornick, Stinchcombe, 
White, among many others, have since published various renditions of Kolmolgorov’s original proof, which is essentially the version found in this paper.

That Hilbert’s thirteenth problem has more than a curious relevance to connectionist artificial intelligence is not obvious. As with most interesting 
mathematical problems, the demesne, including both the problem space and the solution space, typically turns out to be more applicable to various 
disciplines not formally intended. This new-found applicability to other pursuits is the situation for Hilbert’s thirteenth problem, for it is the case that 
Hilbert’s thirteenth problem may be understood as a special case of the computational structure in artificial intelligence known as the artificial 
neural network. To be sure, Hilbert was unaware of this connection if not for the simple fact that cybernetics was only in its incipient stages 
during the turn of the century, but he obviously deemed it of particular significance being that it was included in his famous paper presented to the 
Second International Congress of Mathematicians.
