The invention of the modern form of cellular automata is generally accredited to the gifted mathematician John von Neumann. 
Von Neumann was developing an abstract model of self-reproduction in biology when he discovered cellular automata. 
         </p>
         <p>
He first began by working on three-dimensional models of factories described by partial differential equations around 1947. Then, by a suggestion 
from Stanislaw Ulam, he simplified his model to two-dimensions and came up with the finite cellular automata. He apparently wanted the model to 
be continuous and thus amenable to the calculus so that he could transform the problem into partial differential equations.
         </p>
         <p>
In the early 80’s, Stephen Wolfram began publishing papers on cellular automata which served to bring attention to the subject. 
Wolfram studied the very simplest type of cellular automata: one-dimensional, nearest-neighbor ruled automata.
         </p>
         <p>
These automata consist of a row of cells which get produced for each generation, or time step. Each cell can be either black or white. 
The cellular automata rules take a given cell and consider the three neighbors above the cell: the cell immediately above, the cell that 
touches the left corner, and the cell that touches the right corner in the row above. Based on whether those cells are white or black, 
the rule will then color the current cell either white or black.
         </p>

         <p>
For instance, an example of a cellular automata rule is the following: if the left cell is black, the center cell is white, and the right 
cell is black, then color the current cell black. This is just one rule however, out of all the possible rules for three cells. 
Since each cell can be either white or black (two values) and there are three permutations of these values, there are 2<sup>3</sup> 
rules for such a cellular automata.
         </p>
         <p>
Wolfram developed a convenient way to designate rules using the binary representation of numbers. Let the 
triplet (x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, x<sub>3</sub>) represent the three touching cells above the current cell, 
then there are 2<sup>3</sup> = 8 such ordered pairs 
for which a rule must be specified. Thus, Wolfram considered the eighth bit-position in an integer to specify what color 
to assign the current cell if the ordered triplet is (black, black, black). He then considered the seventh bit-position to 
specify the color of the current cell if the ordered triplet is (black, black, white) and so on though all the bit-positions.
         </p>
         <p>
For example, consider the rule set for the following: if all three cells are white, then make the current cell white, otherwise 
make the current cell black. In Wolfram’s notation, this would be specified as follows. Since the current cell is made 
black in all cases except for the ordered triplet (white, white, white), all bit-positions will be 1 (black) while the first 
bit-position will be 0 (white), then the number is: 11111110. In the base 10 number system, this number translates to 254.
