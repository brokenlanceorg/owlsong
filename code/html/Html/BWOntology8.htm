            Observe that in terms of computer technology, the technological 
            procession has reached the middle of the chessboard. Since the first programmable computers were created around the time of WWII, 
            computing power has doubled 32 times. 
         </p>
         <p>
            Looking at graphs plotted against time, the following technologies exhibit a strong exponential character: 
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li>Random access memory size
            </li>
            <li>Data storage size
            </li>
            <li>Cost performance
            </li>
            <li>Internet bandwidth
            </li>
            <li>Number of Internet hosts
            </li>
            <li>Wireless network cost
            </li>
            <li>Wireless network data rate
            </li>
            <li>Decrease in transistor size
            </li>
            <li>Decrease in physical computer size
            </li>
            <li>Decrease in size of mechanical devices
            </li>
            <li>Etc.
            </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
            Miniaturization of physical devises is also an exponential phenomenon. The science of Miniaturization will produce nanobots, 
            which are essentially tiny devices the size of a cell, and even smaller, that can be used in a myriad of applications.  
            They are currently being used in the form of nanotubes that will be used to create a giant cable millions of times stronger than 
            steel

            functioning as a tether to connect a satellite in geosynchronous orbit. This contraption will function as a space elevator 
            hauling payloads into space at the cost of a few cents a pound. 
         </p>
         <p>
            Nanobots will be used to cure and fight highly mutative diseases 
            such as AIDS and yet-to-be-discovered febriferous agents. Nanobots will be used to construct the future’s microchips. 
            They will be used to modify our senses by attaching themselves to nerve centers in our brains and relaying information back to a 
            central computer. Internet sites will operate programs that can send messages to these nanobots instructing them to excrete this 
            neurotransmitter, or suppress that neurotransmitter, with the end result being a virtual reality created inside one’s mind. 
         </p>
         <p>
            Nanobot-created virtual reality indistinguishable from reality is only the very beginning. Nanobots will also be given the 
            task of mapping, completely, the human brain. 
         </p>

            Every neuron, every synapse, every axon and dendrite will be known exquisitely. 
            From this map, an exact replica can be reproduced in software quite easily. At the current rate of progress, the hardware needed 
            to run the human replica will be ready by 2023.  
         </p>
         <p>
            The human brain has roughly 100 million neurons, with an average of 1,000 
            connections each, with each connection performing 200 calculations per second. This corresponds to 2x10<sup>16</sup> calculations per second, 
            which will cost, in the form of a computer, about 1,000 dollars in 2023; by 2037, 2x10<sup>16</sup> cps will cost a penny. 
            By 2049, 2x10<sup>26</sup> cps, the number of calculations performed by an entire race of humans per second, will cost 1,000 dollars, and by 2059, 
            this same computing power will cost a mere penny.
