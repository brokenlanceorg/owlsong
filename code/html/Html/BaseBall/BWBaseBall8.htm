"Where are your buddies now, huh pussy?" Jaro says and then spits in my face as Cody drags me to my feet.
         </p>
         <p>
Jaro sends a hurtling fist towards my face, and I dodge it the best I can, but his fist still grazes my face and I feel as though my teeth have cut through my cheek. Then, to my amazement, I see Jaro take off running and I feel myself fall to the ground as Cody follows suit. I manage the will to look up and see Varn, Morgan, and Conduff running towards me as fast as they can. 
         </p>
         <p>
"Dude! Are you okay?" asks pudgy Morgan breathlessly.
         </p>
         <p>
I don't even have the energy to respond but about that time I hear the crackling of the loudspeaker and a voice announces: "And that's the ballgame, folks!" 
Somehow even though it seemed as though the game had just started, we had missed almost the whole damn thing. 
         </p>
         <p>
It seemed like that would happen a lot during our lives, feeling as though something had just begun and then realizing it was almost over like someone had pushed the fast forward button on the tape deck of our lives.

Conduff had managed to arrive a little later than anticipated&#9472but yet just in time.  The moment had arrived in which we would be informed that the season was going to be a little longer for some but had ended for others.
         </p>
         <p>
The moment of reckoning we were experiencing that night was a foreshadowing of the manner in which we would be forced to live our lives.  Our choices stretched out before us but yet we never really had a choice.  Our paths seemed to have always been chosen by some other person or some outside force.
         </p>
         <p>
We all knew that we didn't have any control over who would make the team and who would not.  The pain I felt was not simply from the punch Jaro had landed, but was something more complicated.  I was feeling the pain of my life spinning out of my control.
         </p>
         <p>
However, there is satisfaction in the feeling of not knowing what lies ahead or even what's in store within the next few moments.  The satisfaction is that for at least one brief moment, there is hope.
         </p>
         <p>
"Let's go after them," says Conduff calmly looking toward the darkened parking lot.
