Well, this was definitely good news; at least it increased our chances of making an All-Star team. Morgan and I were in the National league, while Varn was in the American league.
         </p>
         <p>
"With any further ado, let's begin with the announcements," Mr. Pounders proudly continues, "First, for the National league, Randy Pounders!"
         </p>
         <p>
"Big surprise," Morgan says sarcastically.
         </p>
         <p>
"…for the American league, Craig McKee." The crowd cheers wildly, but most notably, the girls are screaming.
         </p>
         <p>
"…for the National league, Gary Bohannon…for the American league, Cary Stokes…"
         </p>
         <p>
And on and on the announcements went, until we thought that there was no way we could possibly make the teams. Varn even walked away from the fence out of the glare of the stadium lights. Then, we heard over the static of the loudspeaker…
         </p>
         <p>
"…for the American league, Chris Varner…for the National league, Brandon Benham…"
         </p>
         <p>
"Varn! We made it! We made it!" I say as we all give each other high-fives. I can't believe we're on the team, perhaps they made a mistake…no, no, I can't think that way…

"Get out there you guys," says Morgan excitedly.
         </p>
         <p>
We ran out through the visitor dugout onto the baseball diamond to join the other players. Out on the field, Mr. Bohannon was handing out the All-Star baseball caps.  From the way the rest of the boys reacted when Varn and I were chosen you would think we were all the best of friends.  Actually, Varn and I were strangers to the rest of the boys because we attended a private school under the shadow of a fundamentalist Baptist Church that had tried to quarantine us from the public school kids and the outside world.  Even to this day I don't know if the church had built its security fence to keep others out or just to keep us in.
         </p>
         <p>
"…and there's your All-Star teams for this year," finishes Mr. Pounders.
         </p>
         <p>
That summer turned out to be one of the best in memory. For the rest of that summer, we practiced hard, and we played harder. We ate, slept, and breathed baseball. During the day, under sunny skies, Varn and I would practice at the old feed mill park; during the night, under the stadium lights, we would practice with the All-Star team. All the practice paid off:  We had baseball cards made with our pictures and stats on them, and Varn won the MVP award in the semi-final regionals for the American squad, while we (the National league team) slaughtered the favorite-to-win Mountain View team 23 to 7 in the quarter final district.  For that one year in our lives, it seemed like we had managed to push the clouds back away from the sun and prolong the days of summer.
