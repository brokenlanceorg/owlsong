I was starting to feel a little queasy, which I thought was nervousness, but it was due, in no small part, to the aroma of chicken manure wafting through the ballpark. This particular ball field was situated next to a truck terminal. At this hour of night, most of the chickens had been unloaded and the trucks were being washed down inside a crude wind tunnel.

Varn began to speak in one of his tones that seemed as though he were speaking to the crowd but in actuality he was really just sort of talking to himself.  "It doesn't really matter whether we are All-Star material or not" he sighs, "all that matters is that we didn't kiss anybody's ass just to play a little baseball."
         </p>
         <p>
Pudgy Morgan looks on with a gaze in his eyes like he has no idea what Varn is talking about. "I never kiss anybody's ass" Morgan says "But I sure would like to make the team.”
         </p>
         <p>
I gazed onto the field as if I were not listening but I was actually contemplating what Varn was going to say next as if I were saying it myself, "If you have to suck up to drunken fools and parents who act like prostitutes just to make an All-Star team, don't you think that the game just wouldn't be any fun anymore?" 
         </p>

Morgan simply shakes his head at the comment and starts to slide down on the bleachers as though he was distancing himself, but, really, he was simply confused.  About that time, I looked at Varn and then nodded toward the dugout as a man lifted himself up with assistance from a few of the players, and emerged from the dug out and slowly began to walk in our direction. Each massive step the man took seemed it would nearly burst the air pockets in his "Air Jordan" shoes.
         </p>
         <p>
We could smell the faint scent of a cigar as the heavy man approached, but the odor would mix with the smell of the rot gut chicken trucks creating a smell of burned bones which almost hypnotized us as we stared with glassy eyes at the larger than life figure that was towering before us.
         </p>
         <p>
This elderly man was anything but handsome and actually had the face of an ogre, but his mannerisms were slow and gentle and he had dedicated his life to trying to make the game fun but had lost out to the multitude of madmen who called themselves parents.
         </p>
         <p>
This gentle beast was known only as "Roy" and if you asked me to repeat just one thing he had told us I wouldn't be able to.  I also couldn't tell you where he came from or why he was even there.
