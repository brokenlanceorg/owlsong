I can also remember watching a group of kids play "cup-ball" in the alley next to the concession stand. ("Cup-ball" is a scaled-down version of baseball for the poor wherein the arm and hand serve as a baseball bat, and a used paper cup from a nearby trash can serves as the baseball when squashed down properly.) Some of the kids were actually pretty good. In about five years, they would be sitting where we were and wondering if they were going to make the All-Star team as well. I could see one particular loner watching the action in much the same manner as I was doing. And then I remember….

"I thought Conduff was going to meet us here tonight?" I ask.
         </p>
         <p>
"Yeah, he said he was going to meet us here," replies Varn.
         </p>
         <p>
And now I can see Cody Autry walking up the bleachers in our direction, and following behind him is Jaro and his girlfriend. They are two years older than we, and somewhat imposing. There's room for only two people next to Morgan, and it looks like they are going to sit there.
         </p>
         <p>
"Move over fat-ass," says Jaro in a thick Southern accent.
         </p>
         <p>
         </p>
         <p>
         </p>

I know that Jaro said that to Morgan, but I wonder if he was saying it to Roy as well. The thought just begins to anger me all the more, and I feel the adrenaline coursing through my veins.
         </p>
         <p>
"Them faggots look queer in them pants and them girly socks," quips Cody loud enough for us to overhear. Jaro's girlfriend releases such an energetic laugh that half the spectators turn around to see what's going on.
         </p>
         <p>
Varn and I are glancing at each other and begin to sit upright clenching our fists and tightening muscles as if ready for combat.
         </p>
         <p>
"They're called stirrups," clarifies Morgan.
         </p>
         <p>
Jaro jumps up and grabs Morgan by the shirt and throat and slams him up against the back railing of the bleachers. "He weren't talkin' to you shithead."
         </p>
         <p>
I tried to push Jaro back but by this point, there were so many arms and hands everywhere, I couldn’t do anything. Big Roy slowly stood up and parted us like the Red Sea: "Now that's enough," says Roy calmly and methodically. "You boys need to move on," he commanded.
