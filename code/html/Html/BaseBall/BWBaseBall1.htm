         <p>
Even though the day was blisteringly hot, the night seemed a little chilly with the brisk wind blowing through the ballpark. The stadium lights always make the night feel cooler than it really is by casting their eerie-blue glow over the bleachers, the audience, the chain-link fence, everything.
         </p>
         <p>
I loved watching games from the top row of the bleachers&#9472it gave me the euphoric feeling of watching the action from above. I was used to seeing the game at the field level through a player's eyes, but on this particular night, I was only a spectator at the last regular-season game.
         </p>
         <p>
I felt sick with anticipation and anxiety, or maybe it was from the smell of the nearby chicken plant&#9472the brisk wind brought more than coolness with it. After the game, the year's All-Star team would be named.

I can almost smell the air and hear the sounds as if I were there again watching with a mixture of emotions.  Yes….I can see it now…..It looks like the whole town is packed into Tyson park tonight; there's standing room only. (Actually, I wouldn't know if the stands are this full during regular-season games. When I was actually playing, I made it a point never to look into the stands. My dad had told me that a player's focus should be on the game, otherwise, concentration, along with the game, would be lost.)

"Do you think we'll make it?" asks the pudgy boy.
         </p>
         <p>
"I don't know," I reply instinctively. Morgan has been asking Varn and me that question all night long. I wish he would quit asking. 
         </p>
         <p>
Without saying anything, Varn nudges me on the shoulder and casually points down to the front of the bleachers. Scanning through all the people walking to and fro, I spot McKee strutting along the backstop trailed by three nice-looking girls.
