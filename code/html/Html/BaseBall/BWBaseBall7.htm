Jaro eyes us menacingly as he walks down the bleachers. "I'll git you," he says to the three of us, but to no one in particular.
         </p>
         <p>
"You alright Morgan?" asks Varn.
         </p>
         <p>
"Yeah, I think so," he responds while rubbing a dark red spot on his neck.
         </p>
         <p>
"Your shirt is torn," I point out.
         </p>
         <p>
"My mom's gonna kill me," answers Morgan.
         </p>
         <p>
"Damnit, I hate those rednecks," growls Varn.
         </p>
         <p>
I silently stare at the stadium light reflected off the bleachers contemplating how we can revenge ourselves. I can feel my muscles shaking from all the adrenaline.
         </p>
         <p>
Then Roy says in a solemn voice: "Boys, don't you worry about them. Some day soon, you'll be the ones in control." With that, Roy walks down the bleachers and off into the crowd.
         </p>
         <p>
"What the hell does that mean?" asks Morgan, still rubbing his neck.

"I don't know, but I need something to eat. Do you guys want anything?" I say and start to head off to the concession stand.
         </p>
         <p>
"No, I can't eat anything now," says Varn.
         </p>
         <p>
"Me neither," agrees Morgan.

I walk down to buy some sunflower seeds and a Mountain Dew, and try to calm down by watching the kids play cup-ball. 
         </p>
         <p>
I can hear the 'ping' of an aluminum bat and then I hear someone say "Heads up!" The batter sends a foul ball overhead and into the parking lot. All the kids instantly quit the cup-ball game and race after the foul ball. (Whoever turns in a foul ball to the concession stand gets a free large drink of their choice.) I followed the kids into the parking lot to see who will emerge the champion&#9472the loner I spotted earlier has a jump-start on everyone. Just when I thought he was about to grab the ball, the wind gets knocked out of me and I feel a clenched fist bury itself in my stomach. I dropped to my knees grasping for breath; I feel as if I'm going to throw up. My vision blurs, but I can make out the sunflower seeds mixed in with the yellow Mountain Dew on the pavement.
