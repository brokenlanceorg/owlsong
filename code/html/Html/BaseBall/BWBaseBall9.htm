"Naw, I'm alright," I say after feeling my wind come back, "we'll deal with them later. They're about to announce the All-Star team. Let's go over to the third-base fence so we can see better."
         </p>

The stands were completely packed, and the standing crowd had swelled from the concession stand all the way to the backstop; even the mothers and daughters that were running the concession stand had closed up shop and were trying to find a clear spot to view the pitcher's mound where Mr. Pounders stood with a microphone.  I could see Conduff weaving his way through the crowd but then lost sight of him as he was swallowed up by the wave of people that had emerged from every crevice of the ballpark. Conduff had disappeared as quickly as he had arrived.

I joined Morgan and Varn in an open spot we found along the third-base line next to some cup-ball players who eyed us in a peculiar way as we nudged in amongst them, and I suspected they looked at us in that manner because they just witnessed the fight.
         </p>
         <p>
"Good evenin' folks," Mr. Pounders begins. "Well, it's been a tough season this year, but I'm sure most of y'all aren't ready for it to end. But don't worry, we still got some more baseball with this year's All-Star team, and if this year's team is anything like last year's team, y'all should see some good ball playin' Ain't that right Randy?"

As he finished this last sentence, Mr. Pounders gave a wink to his son sitting on the front row of the bleachers with McKee, Holt, Bohannon, and a host of girls. He was referring to Randy getting a single hit in the regional championship game last year when Randy was a twelve year-old on the All-Star team.
         </p>
         <p>
"Oh brother! It's been a whole year and he's still talkin' bout that stupid hit!" complains pudgy Morgan, "I could've done that, sheesh."
         </p>
         <p>
Varn looked at me and just shook his head in disgust. The sad part about it, Mr. Pounders never acknowledged Tommy Wyatt who hit .817 with 31 RBIs in five games. Tommy's parents were second-shift factory workers who never made it to one of his games.
         </p>
         <p>
Mr. Pounders continues, "This year we're gonna try somethin' a little different. Instead of havin' one All-Star team, we gonna have two All-Star teams, one for the National league, and one for the American league."
         </p>
         <p>
We all look at each other with surprised glances.
         </p>
         <p>
"Since we had such a large group of talented boys this year, I decided," ….Big Roy raises a disapproving eyebrow at Mr. Pounders…, "we decided that it would be better if we had two teams instead of one."
