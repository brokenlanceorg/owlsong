I shrug silently while staring at the complex web of railing and rafters that make up the bleachers below our feet. The best thing about it, though, was the local newspaper photographer happened to take my picture on the full count pitch when the bases were loaded. It wasn't a pretty homer, but it went over all the same and we won the game. My picture was in the sports section the next day.
         </p>
         <p>
"Varn, you hit five homers, right?" I ask, looking up from the bleachers. 
         </p>
         <p>
"Five, and an inside-the-park," Varn stated with a slight sense of satisfaction.
         </p>
         <p>
Morgan chimed in: "Benham, you should've seen the last one he hit! It nearly hit the nursing home!"
         </p>
         <p>
"I heard about it! Wish I was there."
         </p>
         <p>
Normally, I would watch my buddies' games, but on that particular night, my team was playing the Astros. I heard that Varn's blast was incredible&#9472the thing almost hit the nursing home, which is two hundred feet past the left-field fence!

Aside from your daddy being coach or chairman, the next best way to get onto the All-Star team was to hit plenty of homers, which was unfortunate, because even if Varn didn't hit a single homer, he should have been on the team anyway&#9472he was the best damn catcher in the town. No matter where the pitcher sent the ball, Varn could stop it dead in its tracks; very few balls or base-runners got past Varn.

Anyway, like I said, this was the last game of the season, which was held, as always, at Tyson Park, and afterward, as always, the announcements of the All-Star team would be made.
         </p>
         <p>
Tyson park was built by the local chicken processing company to enable the city's youth to enjoy America's pastime. In actuality, near most of Tyson's plants and truck terminals, the employee union mandated that an additional tract of land be set aside for a baseball or softball field, which the union agreed to share with the city’s Babe Ruth league. In this way, Tyson emerged as a philanthropic institution while garnering a tax-cut.
