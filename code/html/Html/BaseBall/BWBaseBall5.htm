He didn't have any young children or even grandchildren…he was just there and as far as we knew, he had always been there. We would later (only half-jokingly) refer to him as the “godfather of Tyson park.”
         </p>
         <p>
We made a space between us for Roy to sit, and he lumbered over as though he had some words of wisdom to share, but instead…….he just sat down and didn't say a word.
         </p>
         <p>
So there we were, the four of us staring into a faceless crowd and glancing down every once in a while to the players on the field.  We sat there silent and couldn't even look at each other because we all knew the outcome of the evening as though the man on the loudspeaker had already pronounced our fate.
         </p>
         <p>
"Now pitching for the Indians, Jeff Swafford," screeched the loudspeaker.
         </p>
         <p>
"I could never hit Swafford's fast-ball," admits Morgan.
         </p>
         <p>
"You've never hit anyone's fast-ball," I retort.
         </p>
         <p>
"Shut up! He's struck you out a time er two" Morgan says as he hits me in the shoulder.

Morgan was a good friend, but an All-Star baseball player, he was not. He had a long face with front teeth that seemed larger than they should’ve been; he was overweight and slow, but he always brought a laugh wherever he would go. A laugh was a luxury that Varn and I were never allowed at the strict and private, Shiloh Christian school we attended, and when we could get one, we enjoyed it immensely.
         </p>
         <p>
"My dad said he almost hit Swafford's dad on route 71 the other day," says Varn.
         </p>
         <p>
"He's darned hard to see when he's slumped over that bag of his. My dad says he looks like a damn feather pillow on the side of the highway," Morgan responds.
         </p>
         <p>
Swafford's dad was gainfully employed on only a few rare occasions. When he was working, he could be found picking up chicken feathers along the roadsides in and around Springdale, particularly near the pre-processing chicken plants. There was a factory in Springfield, Missouri that manufactured pillows using chicken feathers, and Swafford's dad was one of their sources of feathers.
