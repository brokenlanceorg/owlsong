"What a life," I say. McKee seemed to have life handed to him on a silver platter. His parents played the social game to get their son into everything particularly those things that he didn't deserve to be in. To be sure, his mom played the social game to get her son on the All-Star team this year even though I could've struck him out nine times out of ten. One could judge how well McKee's mom played the field by noting what team and what position McKee ended up playing.  Later in life she would have to work at it extra hard in order to make up for McKee's drunken fool of a father.  I think she finally died from exhaustion.

"I bet Bohannon makes the team," offers Morgan.
         </p>
         <p>
"You can count on that," replies Varn unenthusiastically.
         </p>
         <p>
We all knew that Gary was going to be on the All-Star team, after all, his dad, Mr. Bohannon, was the coach.

"I thought twelve year-olds are too young to be on the All-Star team," I protest.
         </p>
         <p>
"Try telling that to his dad, or Mr. Pounders, and you'll find yourself kicked out of the league," replies Morgan.

Randy's dad, Mr. Pounders, was the chairman of the baseball league and drinking buddy of Bohannon's dad, which, of course, implied that Randy would always be on the team. Mr. Pounders was also one of the local dentists in town and we always suspected that he would get a little juiced up on the laughing gas before stumbling to the park.

"Man, we worked too hard this summer not to make the team," said Varn in my direction.
         </p>
         <p>
"No doubt, but I still couldn't get out of that damn slump until the last game," I reply dejectedly.
         </p>
         <p>
Varn and I had practiced almost every day this summer. Since both of our mothers worked at Shiloh, we would go to work with them, and then walk to the old field next to the feed plant. We'd play from seven o'clock in the morning until late in the afternoon when we'd then walk to Wal-Mart and buy as much RC cola as our pooled allowances could get. We bought the two-litter supply and rationed it out in Styrofoam cups because we knew we could save a few pennies by not buying canned soda. 
         </p>
         <p>
"You busted out of that slump though, and that's what matters," said Morgan with a touch of pride.
