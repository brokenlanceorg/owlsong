           Even Maxwell predicted that electro-magnetic energy E would possess momentum: p = E / c,
           where c is the speed of light. Since the speed of light can be expressed in terms of its
           frequency, the speed can be written c = 
           <span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">l</span></span><span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">n</span></span>. 
           Substituting into the equation of momentum
           yields: p = E / <span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">l</span></span><span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">n</span></span>. 
           Now, if we use Plank's hypothesis, E = h<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">n</span></span>, the momentum then becomes:
           p = h<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">n</span></span> / 
           <span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">l</span></span><span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">n</span></span> = h / 
           <span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">l</span></span>. Solving for the wavelength: 
           <span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">l</span></span> = h / p; thus an expression for the
           wavelength of the light is obtained. This result has also been verified experimentally.
         </p>
         <p>
           Thus, it seems that light can behave like a particle p = h / <span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">l</span></span> 
           or as a wave <span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">l</span></span> = h / p depending on how we want to view it.
         </p>
         <p>
           Since light can behave like particles, could classical particles such as electrons and protons
           behave like waves? The idea that matter consists of 'matter waves' was treated in Louis
           de Broglie's 1924 doctoral thesis. This idea seems ludicrous at first glance, but take
           note of the minuteness of Plank's constant h = 6.626 x 10<sup>-34</sup> Joule / sec.

           This minuteness implies that for objects that have high velocities or masses, the matter wave
           is extremely small, however, for objects whose momentum is on the order of Plank's constant,
           the wave can become appreciable.
         </p>
         <p>
           For example, an 800 kg car moving at 20 kg/sec would have an associated matter wave on the 
           order of 4.1 x 10<sup>-28</sup> &#197ngstroms (an &#197ngstrom is 10 x 10<sup>-10</sup> of a meter), 
           which is significantly smaller than the atomic nucleus; a proton with energy 1 keV would 
           have a matter wave on the order of .009 &#197ngstroms, which is subatomic in size, while an 
           electron with energy of 1 eV would have a matter wavelength of 12.3 &#197ngstroms, which is
           as large as some molecules.
         </p>
         <p>
           How could matter waves be proven? One way, as de Broglie pointed out, is to get protons or
           electrons to interfere with each other to produce a diffraction pattern. Just as Young's
           double slit experiment showed the interference properties of light waves, one could use
           a double slit experiment to exhibit the interference properties of matter waves.
