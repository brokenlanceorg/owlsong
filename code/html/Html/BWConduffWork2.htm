            I've seen through history the concept of heaven and hell created by men--created by men to 
            hold the flocks in place,
            to keep the ne'er do wells in line, to keep the people thirsting for their heavenly afterlife and 
            fearing their damnation for their sins in a fiery underworld.

         </p>
         <p>
            These falsehoods hold to the present day. These lost ones are still teaching their children these absurd
            theologies: philosophies written in lies and fairytales bound in restraints of guilt, fear, and shame--it
            is time we wake up. The gods we've known are no longer, and they never were.
         </p>
         <p>
            We should teach our children responsibility, and stop teaching them mythology. Children should take pride
            in their individuality and be taught to explore the world. No longer should we poison the youth with 
            the stifling nonsense of the gods man hath created. I've seen my father's god and there's nothing there.

            I have been you; I have lived the life like yours. 
            I have seen your elders chastise the weak and the downtrodden.
            I have seen your so-called holy men commit the sins of whores. I have seen the just struck down by the 
            codes of the mob rule. 
         </p>
         <p>
            And this is all about you--you chasing your trends and acceptance, failing while
            succeding and still learning nothing. Basking in the idolatry of pastors, possessions, hymnals, and 
            crucifixes. Living your life as the dead. Life and religion are created by men, you deny your human design
            and effort for your eternal rewards. Your god has entered stage-left into the theater of mythology.
            You are alone in your universe of pipe-dreams and lunacy. Your hypocrisy and sins can not be forgiven.
            You are human, your god is dead. So continue praising and blaming the dead for your Earthly status,
            still blind to the truth that you.... are already dead.
