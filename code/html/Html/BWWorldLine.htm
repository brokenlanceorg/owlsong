         <p>
            As is well known, Special Relativity was the creation of one man: Albert Einstein. This discovery, like most of
            Einstein's discoveries, displays an acumen and an intuitive feel for reality that few scientists enjoy.
         </p>
         <p>
            It was Einstein's genius who considered the notion of the constancy of the speed of light
            for all frames of reference. From this simple observation, it logically followed that
            time and space would contract or dilate depending on one's frame of reference. To see this,
            we begin by introducing the notion of a world-line. 
         </p>
         <p>
            If space and time are plotted on a grid, then one's position through space and time would be 
            traced out in a line--which is known in physic's parlance as a world-line. 
         </p>
         <p>
            In figure 1, space and time are plotted. (To make things simple, we are only considering 
            one space dimension, so instead of having 3 degrees of freedom such as we have in the real
            world, one would only have 1 degree of freedom--one can move left or right.)

         <p>
            Space runs
            east-west, while time is the north-south axis. So, in the figure, person A's position relative
            to himself doesn't ever change, so he is at position zero on the space dimension and as time
            flows forward, his position traces out a vertical line (world-line) in the diagram.
