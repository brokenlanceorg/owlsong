            3. The cosmological argument. All physical things, even mountains, boulders, and rivers, come into being and go out of 
            existence, no matter how long they last. Therefore, since time is infinite, there must be some time at which none of 
            these things existed. But if there were nothing at that point in time, how could there be anything at all now, 
            since nothing cannot cause anything? Thus, there must always have been at least one necessary thing that is eternal, which is God.
         </p>
         <p>
            4. Objects in the world have differing degrees of qualities such as goodness. But speaking of more or less goodness makes 
            sense only by comparison with what is the maximum goodness, which is God.
         </p>
         <p>
            5. The teleological argument (argument from design). Things in the world move toward goals, just as the arrow does not 
            move toward its goal except by the archer's directing it. Thus, there must be an intelligent designer who directs all 
            things to their goals, and this is God.
         </p>
         <p>
            Observe that the first three arguments are just disguised versions of the ‘something from nothing’ argument. 
            It does not logically follow that there has to be a God, for then the immediate question would be ‘who created God’? 
            If the definition of God is modified to remove the anthropomorphic projections and to delineate a pantheistic God 
            (as held by the philosopher Spinoza, and similar to Einstein’s definition), the debate is nearly commensurate with modern-day cosmology.

            Argument four is absolute nonsense. Consider the mathematical objects called sets. One of the most important properties of 
            sets is cardinality, or equivalently, the number of elements the set contains. Some sets are larger than others, while some 
            are of a smaller magnitude, but the important point is that these degrees of size are well-defined using the idea of a one-to-one 
            mapping-cardinality is not meaningless without the concept of infinity, nor does the concept of cardinality imply infinity exists. 
            According to the logic of Aquinas, a set’s cardinality makes sense only by comparison to the maximum (i.e., infinity), 
            but one must be careful when comparing objects such as these. Although ‘four’ and ‘fifty-five’ are concrete numbers, 
            infinity is not a number. When one is dealing with infinity, the usual rules of simple algebra are invalid as the eminent 
            mathematician Georg Cantor has shown the world. Observe that although the rules of simple addition and multiplication are 
            changed when dealing with infinities, the underlying logic is not contradictory.

            Argument five is clearly argument 1 with the word ‘movement’ replaced by the word ‘design’. Again science disproves this 
            fallacious argument through the observation of the evolutionary process of natural selection. Not only has evolution been 
            overwhelmingly observed in nature (for example, even a cursory glance at the AIDS virus, or the Tuberculosis bacterium, 
            painfully proves evolution), computer optimization programs have been written using this
