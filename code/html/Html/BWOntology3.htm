            such as microchip design, min-max optimization problems, and NP-complete problems. 
            I have written programs employing the genetic algorithm to solve non-linear systems of differential equations. 
            The programs themselves were rather simple, but the level of complexity they achieved was not something that I explicitly 
            coded into the program, the efficacious program designed the complexity into itself. In nature, the program is DNA and the 
            hardware is the world of proteins, molecules, and atoms, while the mechanism of natural selection is survival of the fittest.

            Other examples of mind-numbing complexity being generated from incredibly simple rules are 
            <a href="neural/BWNeural1.htm" target="Main"><span class=linkTextWhite>artificial neural networks</span></a> and 
            <a href="BWFractal.htm" target="Main"><span class=linkTextWhite>Fractal Sets.</span></a> 
            Neural networks are essentially idealizations of the human brain, as such, neural networks can be trained to learn based on the 
            data presented to them. I have written several neural networks in code to accomplish such tasks as approximate complex and 
            difficult-to-compute mathematical functions as well as recognize and predict fractal-like data and behavior. 
            I have also discovered several <a href="BWFuzzyFractal.htm" target="Main"><span class=linkTextWhite>Fractal Sets.</span></a> 
            Fractal sets are mathematical entities that exhibit an enormous complexity resulting 
            from the application of extremely simple and straightforward rules; so as not to digress any further, if you would like to view 
            them click on the links above.

            To be sure, there have been many other proofs such as St. Anselm’s ontological proof, but all have been shown to be mendacious 
            in one way or another.  The problem with these proofs is the wholesale lack of logical reasoning and critical thinking employed 
            by religious organizations.

            Many religions are based on fear, misogyny, and racism, consequently, to keep the masses in check, 
            critical reasoning must be left at the door. Consider the Mormon cult, this cult, like most religions, displays an egregious 
            use of logic. For example, mormonism holds that not only is the Bible the error-free word of God, but that God authored other 
            works such as the Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, The Pearl of Great Price, and depending on whom is solicited other 
            works as well. Since the mormon cult holds that all these works are simultaneously true, they will, for the moment, be admitted 
            to the <a href="BWCloseMindedness.htm" target="Main"><span class=linkTextWhite>debate.</span></a>  
         <p>
            (Analogously, to show that two theorems are logically equivalent in mathematics, assume one is true and then 
            show that the other follows, then assume the second is true and show that the first follows. Here we assume the veracity of 
            the works and then show that a contradiction arises. a.k.a, 
            <a href="BWSqrtTwo.htm" target="Main"><span class=linkTextWhite>Proof by Contradiction</span></a>) 
         </p>
            According to these mormon works, Joseph Smith was a prophet of God. 
            According to legend, Smith was visited by Christ himself (although in his handwritten diary, he was visited by spirits, but 
            later the story was changed to Jesus). It is well known that according to the Bible, God sent Jesus so that certain things were 
            no longer required such as the sacrificing of animals, the enforcement of the old Mosaic law, and among other things, 
            that no other prophets are necessary--for why else send your only begotten son? And then whom does God send once God has sent 
            his only son?-- an uneducated New England farm boy named Joseph Smith?
