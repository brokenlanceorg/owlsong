         Another example of a theorem involving these two properties is Georg Cantor's proof that the set of real numbers is infinitely larger
         than our definition of 'infinity'. Cantor's proof is often referred to as the 
         <a href="BWDiagonal.htm" target="Main"><span class=linkTextWhite>diagonal method</span></a>. This theorem can be employed to show that
         the cardinality of the real numbers on any finite sub-interval is greater than infinity. It quickly follows then that the entire set
         of real numbers is infinitely larger than infinity.

         All of mathematics rests upon the solid foundation of the axiomatic method. Thus, all theorems can be derived from other 'lesser' theorems
         which themselves are ultimately derived from simple judicious axioms. These axioms are self-apparent and obvious to anyone with only an
         exiguous acumen. However, there exist axioms whose apparent meaning is contrary to experience, such as the converse to Euclid's postulate
         that there can only be one line parallel to a given line and intersecting a given point not on that line. Had we humans evolved in a more
         exotic place in the Universe (such as an area near a black hole), we might have first conceived of the converse of Euclid's axiom and only 
         later Euclid's version. Both postulates are axioms as such, that is to say, they can not be derived from other simpler axioms. Moreover,
         each postulate, together with its respective set of axioms, forms a self-consistent geometry.

         How do we know when one axiom is logically equivalent to another? This question troubled mathematicians during the early twentieth century
         (actually, it has troubled them for centuries). Generally, there is no method to determine if one axiom is equivalent to another. If we state
         the one postulate is equivalent to another, this is simply a theorem that can be proved just as any theorem. For example, consider the 
         <a href="BWInduction.htm" target="Main"><span class=linkTextWhite>proof</span></a> that the principle of induction and the well-ordering 
         principle are logically equivalent. This <a href="BWInduction.htm" target="Main"><span class=linkTextWhite>proof</span></a> shows that the 
         two axioms are in fact logically equivalent. The proof does this by first considering the Principle of Induction as an axiom and then shows
         that the Well-Ordering Pinciple follows. Then, the Well-Ordering Principle is taken as an axiom and the Principle of Induction is proven to 
         be a consequence. 
         </p>
         <p>
         The proof is indispensible to mathematical and logical thought. It is a tool that, when used correctly, can answer once and for all time
         the question of the validity of a statement. Without the proof, epistemology would have gotten nowhere since the time of the ancient
         Greeks, and we wouldn't have been able to create engines, roads, computers, space ships, etc. All branches of learning should aspire to the 
         rigour and certainty of mathematics.
