            The scientific method has been rolling for centuries now explaining what was once thought inexplicable. 
            Until 1930 and perhaps a little beyond, it had been the general consensus in the scientific community that all natural 
            phenomena would yield themselves to scientific scrutiny and complete description in rigorous theory. However, modern sciences 
            such as biology, cognitive science, and psychology are importuning to the emergence thesis. 
         </p>
         <p>
            In essence, the emergence thesis holds that in certain configurations of matter and energy in the universe yield forth 
            ‘emergent properties’. These ‘emergent properties’ are inexplicable in terms of the underlying configurations of matter and energy, 
            hence the term ‘emergent’. The thesis continues by assuming that the phenomenon under scrutiny, since the phenomenon is emergent, 
            is irreducible even in scientific discourse. 
         </p>
         <p>
            The putative progenitor of the emergence thesis is John Stuart Mill. In his <I>System of Logic </I>(1843), Mill delineates, 
            in the 'Of the Composition of Causes' chapter, his theory of emergent properties. Consider the following chemical process: 
            CH<sub>4</sub> + 2O<sub>2</sub> --> CO<sub>2</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O (Methane + oxygen produces carbon_dioxide + water). For Mill, the products of such chemical 
            reactions are not, in any sense, the sum of the effects of each reactant  (McLaughlin, 1992, p.60).

         <p>
            Today, we can, ipso facto, reductively explain this scenario to any degree of accuracy. Moreover, most of chemistry can today 
            be explained reductively; for contemporaries of Mill and many philosophers and theologians before modern science, chemistry was 
            indeed an emergent field. 
         </p>
         <p>
            Other branches of the sciences such as biology and cognitive science now utilize the emergence thesis in place of pure 
            science claiming that complexity has rendered the phenomena irreducible. Biology claims that certain behaviors of biological 
            systems are emergent. Cognitive science claims that consciousness, the feeling of immediate experience that we all share 
            (in one way or another), is an emergent property of brain function. 
         </p>
         <p>
            Could it be that these sciences are waving the white flag prematurely just as chemistry did 150 years ago? Or is it the case 
            that science has indeed met its end-all application? Essentially: do emergent properties actually exist? To answer this question, 
            unequivocal definitions must be set forth.
         </p>
         <p>
            Before a definition of emergence is given, it will be advantageous to first define <I>supervenience</I>. We say a set of 
            properties B supervenes on a set of properties A if and only if there can be no changes or differences in B without there 
            being changes or differences in A. What is being said is that the properties B are fully determined by the underlying properties A. 
            Thus, if a brain that is conscious has its brain state modified in some manner (neurons misplaced or internal electrical current modified), 
            then its state of consciousness changes correspondingly.
