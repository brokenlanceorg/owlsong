            That is to say, the process begins with an initial population of individuals. Each individual is initialized with 
            a random genome; a genome is made up of a set of chromosomes.
         </p>
         <p>
            In nature, a chromosome is a string of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), while a ‘gene’ is a block of DNA, or equivalently 
            a string of proteins. The genome functions as a complete blueprint for the creation of an organism. Essentially, each gene 
            codes a specific trait for the organism, such as eye color, hair color, etc. Possible settings for a trait such as eye color, 
            for example brown, blue, are referred to as alleles. Each gene has its own locus, or position, on the chromosome. 
            The above is an oversimplification, and thus not an entirely correct explanation of genes and their effects; 
            suffice it to say that genes combine in rather complex ways to produce the phenotype-an organism’s physical and mental characteristics.

         <p>
            In the context of the Genetic Algorithm, each individual in the population represents a point in the solution search space, 
            thus, an individual represents a complete solution to the respective problem. How well an individual solves the particular 
            problem is termed its ‘fitness’. Those members of the population that have a better fitness are more likely to survive and 
            reproduce than those of the population that have a worse fitness. 
         </p>
         <p>
            During the reproduction process, the genome must be copied, and during this copying process, it is not uncommon for copying 
            errors to be introduced-otherwise known as mutation. It is through mutation that complex systems adapt and succeed in an environment. 
            The rate of mutations in a population is important; if the mutation rate is too high, the search is basically random-if the 
            mutation rate is too low, then the evolution of the species will stagnate in a local minimum of the population’s overall fitness function.
