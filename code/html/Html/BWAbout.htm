         <span class=bodyGreenSmallJustify>[Introduction]</span><br>
         My name is Brandon Benham. Growing up in northern Arkansas had its advantages and its disadvantages. When all is said and done, 
         the disadvantages far outweigh the advantages. Today, finding myself in a metropolis, I sometimes long for the days of jumping in 
         a little flatbed boat and cruising to some seemingly unexplored <a href="BWCove.htm" target="Main"><span class=linkTextWhite>cove 
         </span></a> of the lake and setting up camp. Out there, in the deeps of 
         the <a href="BWHills.htm" target="Main"><span class=linkTextWhite>mountains and woods,</span></a>
         time doesn’t exist, jobs don’t exist, and the general hassles of life disappear into the mists. 
         When one is at the bottom of a holler in the middle of the night (without a light) and, in the far distance, sounds of crashing 
         trees as if a huge mammoth were trespassing, one’s world of bills, traffic, appointments, etc, recede out of memory. <br><br>
         From my memory, these are some of the very few redeeming qualities of Arkansas I can conjure. However, as effective the advantages 
         are in one’s education, the disadvantages are those that truly shape one’s Weltanschauung. <br><br>

         The natural environment of Arkansas can be very beautiful; so as not to sound like a public relations officer for Arkansas tourism, 
         let the statement stand. One of the reasons it’s beautiful is the <a href="BWDirtRoad.htm" target="Main"><span class=linkTextWhite>
         sparse human population. </span></a>

         Why is it sparsely populated you ask? 
         It is sparsely populated by humans because the land is mostly populated by chickens. That’s right folks, chickens. If you find 
         yourself in the northwest part of the state, take a look at the ground next to the highway. What do you see? What are those white 
         things on the ground and in the ditches? Feathers. These are chicken feathers that fall off the chicken trucks. Now take a deep 
         breath-what do you smell? You’re right again folks, that’s chicken manure. <br><br>
         Some of my childhood memories consist of some permutation or combination of the following elements, 
         <a href="BaseBall\BWBaseBall1.htm" target="Main"><span class=linkTextWhite>playing baseball</span></a> 
         (or any other outdoor activity), the smell of chicken manure wafting in from the truck terminal where the chicken trucks are washed, 
         chicken feathers littering the grass and getting caught in the fence, the smell of the leather baseball glove intermingling with the 
         smell of chicken manure, the sound of an old pick-up truck being driven beyond its limitations. This last element brings us to the 
         next topic.<br><br>

         <span class=bodyGreenSmallJustify>[The Redneck Factor]</span><br>
         What is a ‘redneck’? I define a redneck to be someone who suffers from a severe case of 
         <a href="BWCloseMindedness.htm" target="Main"><span class=linkTextWhite>
         close-mindedness</span></a>. This ‘redneck’ is someone who is not only close-minded, but employs no logic in his or her ‘reasoning’. 
         Remember the restaurant scene in Easy Rider?
