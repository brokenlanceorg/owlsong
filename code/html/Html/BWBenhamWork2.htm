         The first song Varn and I wrote together was titled <i>Times Long Gone</i>. This month's mp3 is an arrangement of that song. Varn wote
         the lyrics while I wrote the music, (this version doesn't contain the guitar piece I wrote--maybe in a later mp3).
         </p>
         <p>
         I had been working on the music for a while: the main theme I had worked out, but the subtle nuances were difficult to manage. I would
         try one voicing of a chord, then another, still another; nothing seemed to work. One spring day, I played the song to Varn and he
         immediately wrote down the lyrics right there on the spot. The words were infused with meaning and so appropriate...so perfect, that I
         was able to finish the guitar, and <i>Times Long Gone</i> was born.
         </p>
         <p>
         Since we didn't have a decent recording, I decided to re-arrange the piece. This new version has a distinctive pensive character that 
         should not be confused with melancholia. The background music is Aphex Twin an ambient or melodic trance electronica.

         This month's mp3 is actually two different versions of the same song.
         </p>
         <p>
         The first mp3 is essentially a poetry reading against background music, while the second
         mp3 is my re-arranged guitar piece of the original song, (written by me and Varn).

         <p>
         Trees larger than life<br>
         Soft driven strife<br>
         The hilltop in the distance<br>
         Recalls a familiar tune<br>
         As trees grow and flowers bloom<br>
         But something special covers my eyes<br>
         As hope propspers and people die<br>
         Tunnels barrow into the souls<br>
         Of mortal men that we all know<br>
         But times of old are all long gone<br>
         And places I've loved are in my song<br>
         Looking at the places I've been<br>
         Wondering if I'll see you again<br>
         I know that it's been said:<br>
         "Everyday people have got into your head"<br>
         </p>
         <p>
         Sunlit fields of green<br>
         My eyes they see everything<br>
         But I see the sun still shines<br>
         Upon far off places and fields sublime<br>
