           The idea was to point the apparatus in the direction of motion, send the light down their respective
           paths, and recombine the light rays to see if they interfere. (If the light took longer when 
           going through the aether, it should manifest itself as being out of phase with the other 
           beam of light.) 
         </p>
         <p>
           Another way of looking at the experiment is to observe it from a different frame of reference; 
           specifically, from a stationary frame of reference with respect to the moving frame of reference.
           There are several ways of doing this. A simple way is to have the 'stationary' observer position
           himself at the North pole, while the apparatus is some distance away, thus the rotation of the Earth
           serves as the moving frame of reference.
          </p>
         <p>
           At this point, the experiment will resemble figure 2, that is, the apparatus is moving with a 
           constant velocity v with respect to the stationary observer. What we want to do is to compare
           the time it takes for the light rays to complete their journeys to and from the end mirrors.

           To do this, we will compute the 'top' light ray and then the 'bottom' light ray and see if they
           agree. Moreover, we will break the journeys into the following: time t1 is the time it takes
           for the bottom light ray to leave the light source and hit the end mirror, time t2 is the time it
           takes for that light ray to leave the end mirror and return back to the half-silvered mirror.
