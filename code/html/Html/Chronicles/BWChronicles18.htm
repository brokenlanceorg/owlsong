The three council members were pleasantly surprised and exchanged astonished glances. That Dossette was so eager to create his addition to the others was a good sign indeed.
         </p>
         <p>
“Absolutely,” said Conduff.
         </p>
         <p>
“I already have a symbol in mind, you guys will love it. But, let me work on it, and I’ll let y’all know when I’m finished.”
         </p>
         <p>
“Alright then,” said Varn before the three council members turned and ascended the Shire leaving Dossette to work in solitude.
         </p>
         <p>
Once they were out of earshot of Dossette, Varn asked, “Well, what do you guys think?”
         </p>
         <p>
“So far, so good,” said Conduff.
         </p>
         <p>
“He seems eager enough,” responded Benham, “To be honest, I didn’t think he would be that willing to go through with the symbol. I think he’s done fine so far; I don’t think we could ask for more.”
         </p>
         <p>
“No doubt,” said Varn, “I can’t wait to see his symbol, his fresh perspective may be the thing we need to further refine our doctrine.”
         </p>
         <p>
To pass the time, the three engaged themselves in a hearty discussion of Zeno’s paradox. The paradox was one of the many that the young men would dissect and argue about constantly; it, like the character Crowley, was a never-ending source of amusement. Just when they thought they had an ingenious argument invalidating the puzzle, one of the three would prove a counter-argument nullifying the initial solution. On and on they would quarrel about the problem, and a few occasions they nearly came to blows.

On this occasion, Varn suggested there were mechanisms at the atomic level, of which, he said, they were not privy that gave the simple problem its paradoxical nature. After a lengthy debate, they had generally considered this path the best approach, though none of them knew the subject of atomic theory at all. Many years later, Benham, while studying Quantum Mechanics, would find a truly adequate solution to the problem that involved discrete mathematics and Max Plank’s constant.
         </p>
         <p>
They had moved on to Berry’s paradox of naming numbers and were discussing the implications when Dossette announced that he was ready for the three to view his symbol.
         </p>
         <p>
“Alright dudes, check it out.”
         </p>
         <p>
The three council members eagerly peered down into the center of the Shire to judge Dossette’s work. The moment of truth was at hand.
         </p>
         <p>
“Okay,” Benham said with a pause, “it’s reminiscent of the air sign of Gemini.”
         </p>
         <p>
“Yes,” added Conduff, “but I know I’ve seen a Gnostic talisman somewhere that has this same character.”
         </p>
         <p>
“I think you’re right Conduff,” affirmed Varn, “didn’t we something similar in that magick compendium text about Solomon?”
         </p>
         <p>
“Ah, that was it indeed. I knew I had seen it before, but I still can’t figure out these protruding segments; they must be some sort of Mystical symbolism.”
