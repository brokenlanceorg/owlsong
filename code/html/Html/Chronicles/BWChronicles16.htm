Satisfied that they had summoned the spirits in proper accord, they began their mystical augury. In this context, the subject of the divination was whether to admit Dossette into the brotherhood. For more than an hour, they turned over the cards, and consulted their tarot books and texts arguing and agreeing all the while over this or that meaning of the ambiguous cards. At one point, it seemed that Dossette was to be admitted regardless, and at another time, it appeared that the cards had spoken against it. So on and on the debate continued over the meaning the cardboard oracle presented. Finally, after much tiresome debate, the three decided upon a new idea.

“Look,” said Varn, “let’s bring him out for one night. But, we give him the task of creating his own symbol out the rocks. If it’s a cool and meaningful symbol, we admit him to the fellowship; simple as that.”

Earlier in the summer, they had created their own “symbols,” similar to the way the members of Led Zeppelin had created their own runes or icons. Since the Shire, and indeed the whole Ozark plateau, was littered with a myriad of chert rocks left over from the great geologic mountain-building episodes a million millennia ago, they used these plentiful rocks to form their symbols in the center of the Shire. Benham’s symbol was an unwieldy conglomeration of several zodiacal symbols, while Varn’s symbol was the Gemini sign taken together with some other Gnostic ornamentation; Conduff’s symbol was entirely original consisting of a divided circle with a thorny vine twisting up its division. Needless to say, the symbols were a little too ornate to lend themselves well to “rock representation,” but the young men knew what they meant, and that was all that mattered.

“Okay, that’s perfect,” agreed Benham, “it shouldn’t be too hard to come up with creative or meaningful symbol.”
         </p>
         <p>
“Agreed,” stated Conduff.
         </p>

“Alright then, I’ll talk to him tomorrow, and I’ll bring him to the next meeting,” said Varn.

With the matter solved judiciously, the three resumed their philosophical debates concerning the finer points of their newly discovered theosophy, and enjoyed what remained of the late-summer night. By the time they left the Shire that night, they would feel prepared to face another day in the little town.

A few days later, when the three were all off work, they met at the Shire. Conduff and Benham had arrived early to set up the chairs and the tape player, while Varn met up with Dossette to give him a ride to the hilltop.
         </p>
         <p>
“Man, I hope this works out,” remarked Benham as he watched Varn and Dossette walk toward the Shire across the wind-blown fields of green grass.
         </p>
         <p>
Conduff simply nodded and took another drag from his non-filtered cigarette while gazing down into the fields.
         </p>
         <p>
When Varn and Dossette arrived, Varn peered at the other two council members through sunglasses that were just visible below the brim of his leather hat that was pulled down low.
