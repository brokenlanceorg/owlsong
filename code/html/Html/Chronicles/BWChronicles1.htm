He had learned how to read the sky. After working at the car wash for a couple of years, Benham could deduce how spectacular a sunset was going to be by noting what type of clouds were floating across the sky at what velocity, and in which direction. Based on this data, coupled with the reading from the barometer inside the car wash tunnel, he could predict, with a rough level of certainty, how good the sunset was going to be.

When one’s job is as monotonous as simply drying off dripping wet cars as they emerge from the car wash tunnel, one’s attention will inevitably drift skyward. This day was no different; Benham’s gaze was fixed on the blue dome overhead as he waited for the next car to emerge from the tunnel. He spied some high-flying cirrus clouds streaking across the blueness. By four o’clock, some cumulus clouds had blown in on the jet stream. 
         </p>
         <p>
He walked into the tunnel and stole a quick look from the barometer before drying off the next car, and that reading confirmed immediately that today’s sunset was going to be spectacular indeed.

Benham’s daydream was interrupted when Steve muttered in a low voice, “You better quit stharing at the sthy or else Bobsth gonna get after you.”

Steve Curtis was an obese forty-five year-old man of rather low intelligence whose sole function in life was driving the cars from inside the car wash tunnel to the open lot outside where they would be hand-dried. He always wore the same shirt (one with a butterfly-collar from the seventies) and the same pair of jeans, and these were the only clothes he ever wore&#9472whether it was the heat of the summer, or the cold of the winter. If, while he was walking, he didn’t reach down and lift up his jeans every few seconds, they would fall down off his waist. His face was hidden by a scraggly beard and large-framed eye glasses, the kind that darken when exposed to sunlight.

Through a sidelong glance, Benham saw Bob, the owner of the car wash, walking out toward him from the tunnel.
         </p>
         <p>
Bob stood up in Benham’s face, “SON, what’s WRONG with you!” he yelled. Everyone at the car wash was looking at the two. “I’m payin you good money to work, NOW WORK!” Benham could make out all the myriad lines and folds that made up Bob’s sun-dried prune-face. It only took a modicum of Benham’s 17-year-old wisdom to ascertain that minimum wage was certainly not “good money.”
