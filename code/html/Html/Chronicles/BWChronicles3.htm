During the last incident two weeks earlier, Benham nearly lost all control. It was a slow day due to the dreary rain so everyone was standing around the washing and drying machines folding towels. Bob walked in with a box under his arm. He said, “Steve, the Lord talked to me during last night’s sermon and he told me to give you some of Jacob’s old, unused clothes.”
         </p>
         <p>
Jacob was Bob’s most obnoxious son.
         </p>
         <p>
“Thanksth bossth!” Steve said happily, while all the other employees traded furtive, questioning glances.
         </p>
         <p>
“Let’s see how this fits you…,” Bob said as he pulled out an old disco shirt that looked like something that was in “Saturday Night Fever.” When he held it up to Steve, it was clear that the shirt was several sizes too small.
         </p>
         <p>
“Awww, well, that’s just too bad,” said Bob mockingly.
         </p>
         <p>
“Maybe theresth sthome other sthirth that will fit me bossth,” asked Steve, and he proceeded to get another shirt from the box.
         </p>
         <p>
“NO!” Bob yelled back, which startled Steve to such a degree that his cigarette fell from his mouth; some of the ashes from the cigarette fell on Bob. The usual scowl on Bob’s face deepened when he said, “You’re too FAT and SMELLY to wear MY son’s clothes! I want you to clock out, go home and take a bath!”

After several seconds of awkward silence, Steve dejectedly shuffled over behind Bob’s flashy, start-of-the-art bass boat and clocked out. Since Steve couldn’t drive, he had to sit in Joe’s car in the parking lot until closing time. Bob knew that Steve and Joe were roommates, and he further knew that Joe was Steve’s only source of transportation. 
         </p>
         <p>
Joe worked in the back with the vacuums; he prepared the cars before they were sent through the tunnel. He looked like a broken-down version of Jimi Hendrix. He and Steve had been buddies since high school; they graduated from Fayetteville’s East campus, where the “troubled” kids went to school.
         </p>
         <p>
It was about forty-five minutes later that the intense remorse began to ferment in Benham’s mind; he felt deeply ashamed that he didn’t do anything, that he didn’t do something. In a blinding rage, Benham grabbed a piece of a metal shaft used to unhook the track that pulled the cars through the tunnel, and hid it inside his towel. He was going to catch Bob inside the tunnel where the lights were low, and the machine noise was intense.
         </p>
         <p>
In a sheer case of luck, Bob had just taken the day’s earnings to the bank. This happenstance gave the analytical half of Benham’s mind ample time to mollify his anger with logical arguments centering on the consequences of his intended actions.
         </p>
         <p>
So it was that Benham developed the technique of talking to himself; some days it worked better than others. “Just one more hour, and you’ll be atop the Shire,” he thought to himself again as he glanced at the silver-lined clouds overhead.
