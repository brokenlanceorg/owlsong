Benham, Varn, and Conduff just stared at him without saying anything.
         </p>
         <p>
“Well,” continued Gabe in a shaky voice, “we are all havin a kick-ass party at the….,” Gabe swallowed, “…the lake; Michelle and Kerry brought their ski boats and jet skis, do….do you all wanna come?” Tom moved a little behind Michelle.
         </p>
         <p>
The three young men knew that Gabe’s invitation was superficial, and further that he only invited them to appease their “good side,” so that they wouldn’t put a curse on him; he had heard the three could put hexes on people. Gabe had inherited his parent’s religious and superstitious proclivities.
         </p>
         <p>
Benham thought to himself, “this is just too damn easy,” as Varn stepped forward and pointed at Gabe. In a low, solemn voice, Varn said: “id quod visum platched.”
         </p>
         <p>
Gabe’s face turned into sheer fright along with Tom, Michelle, and Kerry. They threw their merchandise on the counter and ran out of the store without paying, jumped in the convertible and took off.
         </p>
         <p>
The three laughed at their stupidity. The students were the ones that made up the rumor, and the three young men only capitalized on it. The Latin quote was the only Latin any of the three knew at the time.

Benham watched Bill Moyers’ weekly PBS show on Friday nights when everyone else was at a “kick-ass” party. The philosopher, Mortimer Adler, was the guest one Friday night&#9472Benham made sure he video-taped that episode for Varn and Conduff. Mortimer Adler was also an expert on Aristotelian philosophy, and at one point during the interview he quoted the passage in Latin, which meant: “that which pleases upon being seen.” That Gabe and his cronies ran from such an innocuous Aristotelian quote made the farce seem all the more hilarious.

When the young men stepped outside of the E-Z Mart, they could see the sky beginning to glow in an intense red shade. 
         </p>
         <p>
“Damnit, we’re going to miss it,” said Varn looking at the sky.
         </p>
         <p>
The three jumped into their cars and drove as fast as they could to the Brunner and Lay parking lot. Since the Brunner and Lay factory was operational only during the first shift, their parking lot was empty at this time of day.
         </p>
         <p>
They loaded up Varn’s “boom box” along with the drinks and ice they had just bought at E-Z Mart and began their quarter mile journey across the open fields to the Shire.
