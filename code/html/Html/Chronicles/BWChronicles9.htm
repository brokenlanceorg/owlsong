The three young men looked ragged indeed, though by choice however. They all had unkempt hair flowing past their shoulders, and they all wore black leather boots. Varn’s boots were adorned with copious amounts of silver metal, while Benham’s only had steel toes, and Conduff’s were plain. Benham always wore a black leather jacket with a chain draped over the left shoulder. Conduff wore all black all the time, which contrasted starkly with his long blonde hair. When Varn felt like it, he would wear his black leather brimmed hat, and he always wore his snakeskin belt with the large Aztec-calendar belt buckle.

The young men arrayed themselves in this manner for the simple reason that it upset people. Several years earlier when all three attended the strict, private school, the pastors, deacons, and teachers had told them that to grow one’s hair was to accept evil&#9472this proclamation made absolutely no sense to the young men. Then, at the public school, the teachers and coaches told them they couldn’t grow their hair. No reason was given, only that they </i>couldn’t.</i> Well, since they were told they couldn’t do something, they took it upon themselves to prove that they <i>could.</i>

Varn’s observation turned out to be correct; when they walked into E-Z Mart, they saw Tom and Michelle along with Gabe’s goofy head above the potato chip aisle. Kerry Pocious, Gabe’s current girlfriend was getting a bag of ice from the freezer.

         <p>
Benham, Varn, and Conduff eyed Tom and Gabe menacingly as they walked back toward the soft drink freezers.

“Oh my god, it’s those freaks,” said Michelle to Tom quietly so that the three young men couldn’t hear.

         <p>
“They really scare me,” whispered Kerry as she nudged close to Gabe.
         </p>
         <p>
“Me too,” agreed Tom, “I heard that they are devil worshippers.”
         </p>

A rumor began to spread around the school that Benham, Varn, and Conduff were “devil worshippers.” At any one time in any school in the Bible belt, roughly five percent of the student population is labeled “devil worshippers.” This five percent is usually the sector of the population that is completely misunderstood and yet highly gifted. In this particular case, Varn had scored the highest grade in the “advanced placement” English course taught by the venerable Mr. Baudino. Students began to remark that the only way someone like Varn could score higher than anyone else&#9472including the valedictorian&#9472was through some sort of devilry. Once the three became privy to the rumor, they decided to play with it, to have fun with it. The three decided, one night atop the Shire, to see how far they could go with the rumor.

After the three young men got their drinks, they made their way to the front of the store where Gabe and the others nervously waited in line for the cashier. Gabe was fidgeting uneasily with the potato chips when he turned around to the three and said as if they were old buddies, “what’s up dudes?”
