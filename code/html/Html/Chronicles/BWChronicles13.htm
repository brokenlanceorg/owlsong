The neon-blue glare from the wall illuminated the southern-face of the ice-cooler, the boom-box, the lawn chairs, everything. From their vantage point, the north end of the huge chicken-meat freezer was a giant wall forty feet tall and a couple hundred feet long lighted by several high-powered vapor lamps. The reflected blue light was nearly strong enough to read a book by, even though the giant wall was an eighth of a mile away. This wall was yet another metaphor in the most obvious of forms, and it further strengthened the function of the Shire as a sanctuary, a refuge, from the primitive town.

“I could live out here,” stated Conduff as he stared at the neon wall.

“No doubt about that,” replied Benham as he continued to contemplate the overhead stars.

Varn lit another cigarette and moved one of the rickety lawn chairs closer to the stereo where he adjusted the volume then he sat back as he took a drag from his cigarette and drank in the sweet sounds of Led Zeppelin IV.

After the sunset and the playing of “Stairway,” came the hours of debate and philosophy that gave the young men rich enjoyment. They had been struggling for several weeks trying to develop a coherent and logically sound doctrine about life and reality. The purpose of the ontological doctrine was ultimately satisfaction&#9472satisfaction that they had discovered things about the world using pure reason, and this knowledge was like a piece of the Shire that they could take with them wherever they went.

A week earlier, they had finally finished a rough doctrine which was an assimilation of Christianity, Calvanism, Buddhism, Hinduism, and Mysticism that resolved the contradictions and egregious lapses in logic contained in the Christian doctrine that had been shoved down their throats since they were toddlers. They were quite proud that they had done away with the antediluvian “problem of evil” that many philosophers and theologians had written about, and yet their doctrine still maintained eternal life and an omniscient, omnipotent, and omni-benevolent deity, but it would be many years and much erudition before they would see the errors in their own reasoning that would invalidate the whole edifice. In fact, they were so proud of their achievement, they were willing and eager to share it with others outside their social circle.

But sharing their hard-earned and long sought after theosophy was not something they wanted to do with everyone. They initially agreed, in the spirit of the Mystics, that it would only be a few people with which they would share their sacred and secret doctrine. Tonight’s meeting was a discussion of just whom to invite.
         </p>
         <p>
Varn sat up on the edge of the lawn chair when he began in a serious tone, “as we stated last time, we need to decide on whom we’re going to invite to the Shire to partake of our doctrine.”

“Yeah, I’ve been thinking about that since the last meeting,” said Benham as he dropped his gaze from the starlit sky. “My nomination is Brooks. First, since his dad is in the army, he’s used to finding himself in a new environment constantly; because of this, he’s been an outsider most of his life. Thus, I think he would enjoy the fraternity of a close-nit brotherhood. I also think he would bring a different viewpoint&#9472don’t forget, he’s in AP Calculus after all. He’s got potential. He’s eager to learn and I think eventually he will be a valuable addition to our grotto.”
