Even after the car was finished and most of the employees had clocked out for the day, the pastor still pompously strode around his car talking in hushed tones on his portable phone. The pastor’s eye then caught a “missed” spot on the front fender; he pointed to the first employee he saw, which was Ernie, and motioned him over with his jewelry-encased hand. When Ernie walked over, the pastor kept talking on the phone and just flicked a disdaining wrist at the front bumper indicating that he wanted it washed again.
         </p>
         <p>
In his typical obsequious manner, Ernie tried his best to clean the bumper, but he had been a backseat window-washer for three years, he just didn’t have the physical skill or mental ability to clean smashed bugs off a Lexus bumper. When the pastor realized that his bumper wasn’t getting the proper attention, he shook his head scornfully. Bob had just looked up from checking the timecards inside the car wash tunnel, and noticed that the pastor had Ernie slaving on the bumper. Bob furrowed his eyebrows and marched bow-legged out to the car.
         </p>
         <p>
“Where do you get these guys?” asked the pastor incredulously, “He’s been tryin to get those bugs off for five minutes already.”
         </p>
         <p>
Bob shook his head in agreement with the pastor and then shouted: “ERNIE, you better get them bugs off that bumper, or I’M GONNA PUT THE FEAR OF GOD INTO YOU!”
         </p>
         <p>
Dr. Floyd gave a subtle&#9472but noticeable&#9472laugh.

At this point, Ernie was completely frightened, his hands were shaking and his face was turning red again as if he wasn’t breathing. Ernie was <i>actually</i> afraid that Bob was going to “put the fear of God in him” as it were.
         </p>
         <p>
Benham, along with the others who hadn’t left, observed the whole affair; he also noticed the look of concern and…fear on the face of Ernie’s girlfriend who always picked him up after work. (Although Ernie was less mentally challenged than his girlfriend, it was she who owned a car and drove them around town; Benham always thought that odd.) To end the charade along with Bob’s and the pastor’s sadism, Benham picked up the extra-strength cleaner and a towel, walked out to the car, sprayed the bugs, and then casually wiped them off. 
         </p>
         <p>
“Just walk away and don’t say anything,” Benham thought to himself, “there’s no point in confronting these bastards, besides you’ve got to meet Varn and Conduff before the sun sets.”
         </p>
         <p>
And so he did. Benham just walked away. He got into his car, put in “Purple Haze,” and turned up the tape player as loud as it would go. As he sped out of the parking lot, Benham saw, through his rear-view mirror, Ernie and his girlfriend enjoined in an ungainly, but indestructible, embrace.
