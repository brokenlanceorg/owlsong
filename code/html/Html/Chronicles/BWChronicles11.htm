As the young men neared the Shire, they could feel freedom and happiness begin to flow through their veins once again. The late-summer breeze could be seen blowing the knee-high grass in waves across the fields, and with each wave, the young men inhaled a fresh wave of euphoria. No one said anything as they trekked across the open plains toward the Shire. Across the field, the Shire’s hilltop silhouetted against the first rays of the sunset.

Varn and Benham had discovered the Shire more than half a decade earlier when they were about ten years old. Varn lived about a mile away near the old chicken feed mill plant, which could be seen towering above the trees in the area northwest of the Shire. As children, Varn and Benham loved to play outside in the nearby fields and forests. One sunny Saturday, Varn told Benham that he had always wanted to make it to the top of a nearby hill, but couldn’t because of the surrounding tall weeds and briar patches. So, they snuck into Varn’s grandfather’s barn and found a couple of scythes and headed towards the hill. All day the two cut and reaped their way up the side of the hill to the top. Amidst the six-foot tall reeds and bushes, the boys felt like they were in the middle of an endless jungle. By sundown, they had finally made it to the top. They had enough energy to collapse in the grassy area atop the hill and watch the first of many sunsets from the lofty vista. A couple of years later, after the two had read J.R.R. Tolkien’s “The Lord of the Rings” trilogy, they decided to call it “Hobbiton,” after the name of Bilbo Baggins’ home in the story.

The hobbit’s home had been burrowed out of a little hill, which was similar to their little hill. And yet the three-syllable “Hobbiton” just didn’t have the proper euphonic ring that they wanted, so they later changed the name to the “Shire.” In Tolkien’s trilogy, the Shire was the township in which Bilbo lived; so, even though the name wasn’t completely appropriate (in terms of Tolkien’s universe), the “Shire” namesake stuck nonetheless.

From all outward appearances, the Shire was a hill rising above the fields. But, in structure, the Shire was more of a caldera than a hill; the center of the Shire was a hollowed-out fifteen-foot depression. This caldera structure was the result of bulldozers plowing the detritus from the construction of the nearby chicken-meat freezer into one location. After the construction of the chicken-meat freezer, the detritus was neglected and then soon forgotten. So, in reality, the Shire was nothing more than a heaping debris pile full of scrap metal, rocks, and dirt on which a few scraggly weeds clung for life. However, the young men had learned early on as young boys, that life was what one made of it&#9472and they made the best of it, for, where the average person saw scraggly, allergy-inducing weeds, the young men saw soft, flowing green grass, where the average person saw a thorn patch, the young men saw an exotic garden, and where the average person saw broken bits of twisted scrap metal, the young men saw gems of surpassing wealth.
