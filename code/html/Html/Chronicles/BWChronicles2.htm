Bob was an average, run-of-the-mill citizen of the small town, which implied that he was a fundamental Southern Baptist that viewed himself as ordained by God to “enlighten the heathens.” He hired those who were poor or mentally challenged, but only because he knew he could deride, chastise, and abuse them without retribution, and since they had nowhere else to work, they would remain at the car wash working for minimum wage. Since he had the local conservative politicians in his pocket, he paid no insurance for those poor souls that were his employees, and he paid no taxes on his establishment. To make matters worse for the underprivileged of the small town, Bob had an identical twin named “Bill” who owned all the major utilities in town. Steve had told Benham, on more than one occasion, that Bill was far more cruel than Bob ever was.

As Bob walked away, his scowl caught upon Steve who was just heading back to get the next car out of the tunnel. Bob accosted Steve in front of several patrons: “Steve, did you take a bath last night?”
         </p>
         <p>
Steve hung his head as he always did and began to walk toward the tunnel.
         </p>
         <p>
“Steve, I asked you a question,” Bob repeated with a louder tone. “Did you take a bath last night?”
         </p>
         <p>
Steve stopped walking and stood silently with a bowed head.

“I know you didn’t take a bath, Steve. Do you know why? Because you STINK.”
         </p>
         <p>
Steve was visibly embarrassed, which didn’t happen very often.
         </p>
         <p>
“You better take a bath tonight or else I’ll send you home in the morning.”
         </p>
         <p>
Benham watched as Bob walked over to the patrons and began speaking softly and gesturing apologetically. The patrons first nodded their heads, and then shook their heads disapprovingly, and so on until Benham felt sick inside. It was obvious they were members of Bob’s church, the First Baptist Church, and Bob was detailing every single fault Steve had.
         </p>
         <p>
“Hang in there, boy,” Benham told himself. “Just hang in there for another hour, and you’ll be off for the day, then you can watch the sun set from the sanctuary.”
         </p>
         <p>
Since the last incident with Bob, Benham had got into the habit of talking to himself in an effort to calm his often furious temper. The problem was that he was talking to himself a little too often now. Every person in the small town was as hateful and contemptuous as Bob. Thus, the more people Benham dealt with, the more he had to calm himself.
