Before Conduff even finished his sentence, Varn was shuffling the tarot cards atop the ice cooler. The three had bought the cards together from the only “new age” bookshop in the area. The tarot deck had been designed by the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, a secret society whose members included W.B. Yeats and the infamous Aleister Crowley. Crowley was a never-ending source of amusement for the three&#9472especially for Conduff. When the three learned that Led Zeppelin’s guitarist, Jimmy Page, had bought one of Crowley’s moat-encircled castles, they had to learn as much as they could about the recluse. The images on the tarot cards were taken from Crowley paintings; their favorite, by far, was the hanged man.

The cards were arrayed face-down in four groups of three, with four of the groups placed on the corners of a rectangle and the last group placed in the center. The upper-left group described the subject at hand (which could be anything essentially), while the upper-right group described the subject as it <i>could</i> be in the future. The lower-left group described the situation and circumstances outside the subject as they currently stood, while the lower-right group described the course of circumstances that <i>might</i> happen in the future. The center group was the most important. These cards foretold the future in near certainty; however, whether the events and characteristics applied to the subject or the subject’s outside environment were always, and by intentional design, unclear.

The eerie sounds of Led Zeppelin sang out into the night air as the neon-blue glare from the wall yielded a surreal glint on the proceedings. Benham had copied “the weird section” from Zeppelin’s video, “The Song Remains the Same,” wherein Page played his Gibson guitar with a cello bow; this fitting piece was now playing on the tape player.

Varn cleared his throat and began with the invocation, “I evoke thee IAO that thou wilt send HRU the great…”
         </p>
         <p>
“Hold up,” Benham butted in. “Are you supposed to spell out the names, or read them as full words?”
         </p>
         <p>
“I…I don’t know,” responded Varn.
         </p>
         <p>
“I mean, what if we’re saying the invocation incorrectly?” continued Benham, “The booklet that came with the cards said nothing about the pronunciation of the angel’s names.”
         </p>
         <p>
“I’ve always wondered about that,” said Varn, “if the invocation is done improperly, would that invalidate the divination?”
         </p>
         <p>
“I say we just spell out the names,” added Conduff, “when I was reading some Medieval occult writings the other day, it said that sometimes the deity’s names were never spoken aloud because of their venerated status.”
         </p>
         <p>
“Sounds good to me,” agreed Benham.
         </p>
         <p>
Varn cleared his throat again after puffing on his cigarette, and restarted invocation, “I evoke thee I-A-O that thou wilt send H-R-U the great Angel that is set to reside over the operations of this Secret Wisdom, to lay his hand invisibly upon these consecrated cards of art, that thereby we may obtain true knowledge of hidden things, to the glory of thine ineffable Name, and that thy truth shall come to light and mine questions answered. Amen.”
