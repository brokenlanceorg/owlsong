There was more than the usual number of “blue-hairs” on the highway which served only to inflame Benham’s mounting frustration. He was boiling by the time he finally got around the thirty mile-per-hour moving roadblock consisting of an old senile man in the left lane, and a blue-haired woman in the right lane who drove demonstrably worse than a drunk. There was a retirement community a couple miles to the north near the lake, and it seemed they all left their multi-million dollar estates en masse today.

In the back corner of Mathias plaza where the employees of Harp’s grocery store parked their vehicles, Varn and Conduff were smoking Harley Davidson cigarettes and anxiously waiting.
         </p>
         <p>
“Find anything useful in there Varn?” asked the young man dressed all in black.
         </p>
         <p>
“Nothing today, but we’ll see what tomorrow brings.”
         </p>
         <p>
Varn closed the lid to the garbage dumpster and dusted himself off.
         </p>
         <p>
After a couple of drags from his cigarette, Conduff then asked, “Where’s Benham? He said he was going to meet us here, right?”
         </p>
         <p>
Before Varn could answer, they heard a car speeding through the sleepy shopping center.

Conduff stood and Varn moved a little closer to the two parked cars as Benham pulled up next to them. By the sound of Benham’s engine, they knew he was as ready to ascend the Shire as they were.
         </p>
         <p>
“Goddamn, I’ve got to get the hell out of this town,” exclaimed Benham as he slammed his car door.
         </p>
         <p>
Varn threw a cigarette butt on the pavement and ground it out under his spiked boot more vigorously than the average smoker would have.
         </p>
         <p>
“Yeah, man, I know,” answered Conduff calmly.
         </p>
         <p>
This was their typical greeting. Generally, when they were scheduled to meet, at least one of the trio would arrive late to the rendezvous, today, it just happened to be Benham. And when the tardy individual showed up, he would rant and rave over the uncontrollable circumstances that delayed his arrival. After his fulmination, his mood would turn tranquil, and the world would be seen clearly once again. 
         </p>
         <p>
However, the young men were still gauging the success rate of the method. A week earlier, Varn was late meeting Benham and Conduff in the football parking lot before school. The three always met under the football bleachers to catch a smoke before class started. Varn was furious when he arrived for a couple of reasons. First, he knew that Mr. Ward would give the three detention for showing up late to class.
