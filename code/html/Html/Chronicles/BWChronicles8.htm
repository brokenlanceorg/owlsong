Second, the redneck that was “peeling out” in the road next to the parking lot nearly hit him&#9472this was particularly disturbing to Varn since he worked overtime all summer earning enough money to paint his car a cool silver color, (hence, the appellation “the silver bullet”). When Varn got out of his car, Conduff and Benham could see the veins popping out of his neck. Varn let out a frustrated battle cry and proceeded to slam his car door. 
         </p>
         <p>
He used a little too much force. 
         </p>
         <p>
Even though it had been about a week ago, Varn was still finding bits of broken glass in his car seats and floorboard carpet.
         </p>
         <p>
“Well, it looks like this is gonna be a good one,” said Varn peering into the sky referring to the forming sunset.
         </p>
         <p>
The three knew that a spectacular sunset seen from atop the Shire amidst good company was the drug that kept them alive in the cruel, backward town.
         </p>
         <p>
“We better get going or else we’re gonna miss it,” observed Benham.
         </p>
         <p>
“We’re low on cigarettes,” said Conduff.
         </p>
         <p>
“Plus, we need something to drink,” added Varn, “let’s stop at E-Z Mart on the way to the Shire.”
         </p>

         <p>
When they drove into the E-Z Mart lot, they parked next to a convertible sports car. As they were walking in, Varn noted, “I think that’s Michelle Cherry’s car.”
         </p>
         <p>
“This should be interesting,” replied Conduff as a diabolical grin stretched across his face.
         </p>
         <p>
Michelle’s father was the local city judge, and she and her family lived atop East Mountain, where the wealthiest lived. It was clear that this cheerleader’s life was more opulent that most would ever know. She had trashed more cars than Benham’s, Varn’s, and Conduff’s parents had ever owned.
         </p>
         <p>
Wherever you saw Michelle, you saw her boyfriend, Tom Riplogle. And wherever you saw Tom, you saw his friend Gabe Bowers. Tom was another silver spoon story, and Gabe used to hang around Varn and Benham for a time, when they used to play sports together. Gabe’s only ambition in life&#9472and he had intimated this to Benham during their friendship-was to be voted “the most wild and crazy guy” for every yearbook until they graduated. Thus far, Gabe’s stupid human tricks and “school spirit” had kept him on course, even though he nearly flunked the past two years of high school.
         </p>
         <p>
Gabe refused to hang around Benham and Varn because they weren’t “cool enough.” And when Conduff joined up with Benham and Varn after transferring from the private Baptist school, Gabe broke all ties with his former friends. Gabe felt that being seen with the ragged young men would hamper his chances of being voted into the yearbook.
