“Don’t worry about him Ernie, here, just pull that belt that way and…,” said Benham as he helped Ernie out of the entanglement.
         </p>
         <p>
Jacob didn’t even look at Benham or Ernie and continued where he left off: “so, anyway, the reason Reaganomics is far superior to the Democratic model of…”
         </p>
         <p>
“Dude, just shut up; I don’t want to hear your bullshit today,” said Benham confidently as he wiped the car down.
         </p>
         <p>
Philip and Robert, who were drying off the adjacent car, both looked up as they heard this last comment-no one had ever spoken like that to Bob’s son. Everyone at the car wash had to put up with Jacob’s taunts, mocks, and self-aggrandizement, simply because he was Bob’s son. 
         </p>

Jacob stormed off to go tell his daddy what just happened. When he spun around to go inside, he bumped into Steve: “move it SLOB, and pull up your pants, your butt crack is showing.” Several customers eyed Steve as if he were a monster.

Jacob had just moved back to the small town from Kansas City to work for his 
“daddy” again at the car wash. He had graduated a year earlier from the University with a “double finance degree.” After graduation, he filled everyone’s ears with stories of his imminent fame and fortune. Finally, nine months later, he received an offer for a junior accountant position at a firm in Kansas City. Before he left for his new job, he boasted to Benham and Robert: “Yeah, once they see what I can do, they’ll promote me all the way to the top.”

Jacob had worked at the firm for a mere two months before he came back crying to daddy&#9472the real world was just too harsh; now he slaved with everyone else, in blue-collar fashion, wiping down wet cars as they emerged from the tunnel.
         </p>
         <p>
Benham knew that he’d be back just like everyone else who had left the small town. When someone like Jacob left town to “make it big” somewhere, Benham could predict when they would return. It was a rather simple extrapolation&#9472much like reading the sky&#9472if the person had actually worked to obtain something (a car, a degree, a bicycle, anything) and if the person had dealt with others in the community in an honest and respectable manner, then they would do well in their new home; otherwise, they would fly back to the safety-net of the backward town. The crueler the person was, the sooner they would be back.

They were finally drying off the last car of the day-a freebie for Bob’s pastor. Since it was a freebie, the employees were relaxing their attention to detail: they missed a spot here; they missed a spot there. Even those employees with an IQ of 50 realized that it was the end of a long day, and this customer didn’t pay for their service; (even if he did pay, the money would only fill Bob’s pocket, and since Bob paid no local taxes, nothing would be given back to the community.)
         </p>

The pastor, Dr. Ronnie Floyd, (he was given an honorary doctorate from an unaccredited seminary school in Missouri), strolled around his gold-plated, special edition, Lexus while talking on a portable phone. (At the time, portable phones, not to mention Lexus cars, were very rare, and anytime anyone saw one, it was cause for excitement, which explained why Ernie’s stuttering just increased in intensity.)
