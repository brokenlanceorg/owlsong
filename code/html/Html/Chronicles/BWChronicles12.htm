After the three young men had ascended the Shire, they assumed their usual roles: Benham disappeared into the weeds and then shortly reappeared with two folding, lawn chairs, while Varn descended into thick brush in the interior of the Shire and then reappeared with a medium-sized ice cooler, and Conduff rewound the Led Zeppelin IV cassette tape so that it was poised to play “Stairway to Heaven.” The folding lawn chairs and the ice cooler were godsends procured from the garbage dumpster in the employee parking lot next to Harp’s grocery store. The chairs were dilapidated, and the ice cooler had a couple of fist-sized holes in the exterior, but the items met the young men’s needs. Varn and Conduff rummaged through the dumpster every night after work; they often discovered many a needed item in that manner. Varn was often fond of saying: “one man’s trash becomes this man’s treasure,” as he dug around inside the dumpster.
         </p>
         <p>
Once the three had poured themselves a Styrofoam cup of ice-cold soft drink, Conduff hit “play” on the tape player and the three stood, and ritualistically faced the sunset to listen to the Shire’s anthem: Led Zeppelin’s “Stairway to Heaven.”
         </p>
         <p>
To the young men, listening to the song while watching the psychedelic colors of the sunset blend and form shapes was pure ecstasy. On the surface, the meaning of the song was quite literal: the young men had ascended their “stairway,” which they had bought through the effort of finding and clearing a path for themselves, and on their stairway, they were looking into Heaven and seeing its resplendent beauty with their own eyes, ears, and senses. 
         </p>

         <p>
But on a deeper level the meaning was broader: the song’s message was a message of hope, a message that says that even though sometimes all of one’s thoughts are misgiven, one can follow the path of reason which will lead to a new dawn and a new day of laughter and happiness. Furthermore, the message implied that there was never a lack of time, for if one day you find that you’re on the wrong path, don’t worry, because there’s still time to change the road you’re on.
         </p>
         <p>
It was this deeper meaning that gave the young men such euphoria; it seemed as though they were experiencing hope in its corporeal form as they watched the heavens and listened closely to the music. And in listening, their dreams were confirmed; for in those brief moments, at the climax of the song and sunset, they no longer had hope&#9472nay, they knew that one day they would be free of the oppressive town full of hypocritical and corrupt “Christian” men, and racist, sexist and ignorant rednecks. This knowledge of their eventual liberation gave the young men strength to face the day, and the will to face the next.
         </p>
         <p>
As the song ended and twilight began, a light wind cooled the atmosphere and blew the young men’s hair across their faces. Benham looked up into the darkening sky and watched several stars twinkling in rhythm. 
         </p>
         <p>
“What a beautiful night,” sighed Benham.
         </p>
         <p>
“We finally made it,” replied Varn as if getting to the Shire was their only goal in life.
         </p>
         <p>
For now, The Shire was their only destination; it was their temple, it was their shrine, and it was the only place where these young men could find peace of mind.
