Dossette was the first to speak, “So <i>this </i> is the Shire!” he said in an astonished tone. “I’ve always wondered where this place was; I’ve heard Varner and Conduff talk about it from time to time.”
         </p>
         <p>
“Well, as you can see, it’s not much,” answered Benham, “but, as with so many things in life, it’s what we make of it that really matters.”
         </p>
         <p>
“Indeed,” added Varn, “to most of this small little town, this piece of land is just a worthless debris pile, a refuse heap that no one wants or even cares for. So we decided to turn this trash heap into our own sanctuary&#9472a place where we can be free of the world for a time.”
         </p>
         <p>
“Cool,” responded Dossette.
         </p>
         <p>
“All we ask of each other,” began Conduff, “is that we bring a mind full of ideas and visions, and most importantly, condemn the abhorrent actions of the hypocritical fundamentalists.”
         </p>
         <p>
“In short, we are not a part of those redneck dumbfucks,” Benham boasted. “We don’t buy in to their way of life for it is a farce. We think their methods of small-minded cruelties performed in the name of Jesus Christ is nothing more than utter and complete bullshit.”
         </p>
         <p>
Dossette nodded excitingly; it seemed he absorbed every single word.
         </p>
         <p>
“Out there in that town,” Varn waved a hand in the southwest direction, “they have their cliques and their sports teams and their congregations. Well, we’ve got our own brotherhood, right here,” he waved another arm about the Shire.

“Count me in bro!” said Dossette eagerly.
         </p>
         <p>
“To solidify your membership,” said Conduff, “you must perform one task.”
         </p>
         <p>
“What’s that?”
         </p>
         <p>
“Follow us,” answered Benham as they descended to the inner part of the Shire. “You see those rock formations?”
         </p>
         <p>
“Yes”
         </p>
         <p>
“Those are our symbols.”
         </p>
         <p>
“Symbols?”
         </p>
         <p>
“Yeah,” added Varn, “you know, like Led Zeppelin's fourth album, how the band members each had their own sign.”
         </p>
         <p>
“Oh yeah, ZoSo and all that,” confirmed Dossette.
         </p>
         <p>
The three council members exchanged relieved glances. The fact that Dossette was at least familiar with Zepp IV was reassuring.
         </p>
         <p>
Benham continued, “Those symbols you see before you are steeped in both traditional and personal meanings. Their importance can’t be understated. They symbolize unity, free-thought, learning, mysticism, and all that other good shit.”
         </p>
         <p>
“Can I make one too?” queried Dossette.
