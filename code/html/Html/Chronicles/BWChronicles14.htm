“I don’t know,” started Conduff, “he seems too much the jock-type to really appreciate the Shire. Every time I see him in the halls, or anywhere for that matter, he’s got chicks hanging off him. And all the teachers love and adore him&#9472for reasons that I’m not quite sure of. I just don’t think someone like that could really understand what this place means to vagabonds such as us.”
         </p>
         <p>
“That’s true,” added Varn.
         </p>
         <p>
“We need someone,” continued Conduff, “that knows what it means to be an outsider, who would appreciate a sanctuary from the cruel world. I was thinking of bringing Pheobe up here.”
         </p>
         <p>
Varn grimaced, while Benham walked over to the edge of the Shire.
         </p>
         <p>
“She’s cool. She’s open minded. She would never talk.”
         </p>
         <p>
Pheobe was Conduff’s new love interest. She was a cute, young girl from a white-trash family. She was a shy punk rock girl with a partially shaved head. Pheobe was younger than most freshmen at the high school. She had been elevated a grade in junior high and attended ‘gifted and talented’ as well as AP classes at the school. She was also an emotional wreck. She had been molested by her biological father and two other step fathers since she was five years old. She had been gang-banged by twenty-something year-old trailer trash men at age twelve. She had a series of abusive boyfriends since she was eleven. She was perfect for Conduff.
         </p>
         <p>
“Man, I don’t think I can go for that,” said Benham as he walked back toward the two, “I don’t even know if we should bring chicks up here at all. We really should have another council meeting for that one issue alone.”

Varner hissed, “I just don’t want Spider to sit her fat ass up here at any time, period.” 
         </p>
         <p>
“She won’t” Conduff responded.
         </p>
         <p>
Spider was Pheobe’s best friend. She was an obnoxious attention monger. She was more hideous looking, but less disturbed than Pheobe.
         </p>
         <p>
The last nomination came from Varn. “Dossette,” he announced.
         </p>
         <p>
After a second or two of brief silence, Conduff and Benham nodded slightly.
         </p>
         <p>
Varn continued, “Although he’s not quite the vagabond that we are, I’m sure he’d appreciate it more than anyone else.”
         </p>
         <p>
Dossette was of above average intelligence. He was acquainted with the three through the high school where he was a grade above. He also worked at the grocery store with Conduff and Varner. He was somewhat of a hyper-manic. He was wild, loved life, contentious, and desired to be affiliated. He had terrible taste in women. 
         </p>
         <p>
“I know he’s got the potential; I’ve seen him kick ass in debate class. He slaughtered Steven Green in the school debate tournament.”
         </p>
         <p>
“That’s not saying much,” responded Benham unenthusiastically. “I’m just not sure about him. I hardly know him, but from what I know of him, he might do.”
         </p>
         <p>
“Alright, how about this,” began Conduff, “let’s consult the tarot cards. If they affirm his nomination, we go with him; otherwise, we’ll find someone else.”
         </p>
         <p>
“Agreed,” answered Benham.
