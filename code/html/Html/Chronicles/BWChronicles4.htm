Meanwhile, at the broken down shell of a grocery store where Varn and Conduff worked, a conversation was being held between the store manager, A.J. Brightwell, and his assistant Mack concerning how they were going to handle what they believed was a violation of their crude code of conduct:  "What are we going to do about the length of Varn's hair?" A.J. said with a twisted sort of smile.  A.J. Brightwell would smile in a manner that would make girls think he was looking up their skirts but in actuality his crooked smile was one of many characteristics he received as the result of his first three strokes.

         <p>
Mack would simply sit back with a look on his face like he had no idea what A.J. was talking about.  But then again, Mack usually had no idea what anyone was talking about.  "I guess we should tell him to cut it" Mack said calmly.  The two men continued contemplating how they would approach Varn about what they referred to as their "little problem".  In the meantime, Varn and Conduff were in the stockroom throwing empty boxes into a compactor trying to keep their sanity in an insane environment.

"I'm just going to tell that boy that he needs to get his hair cut 'cause he looks like a girl", A.J. said with another twisted grin.  "Yep, that's what I'd do" Mack replied "and tell him he is breaking the rules!" he added.  This conversation lasted several hours until it was finally time for A.J. and Mack to leave for the day even though they had not accomplished anything.  They prided themselves in self-created moral values but never seemed to master a strong work ethic.  Since it was now time for them to leave, these two jackals decided to "walk the store", glare at Varn, and not say a word.

This pattern of behavior had been going on for several weeks and A.J. and Mack had even set up a surveillance routine where they would sneak up into the cat walk of the store and peer through cracks in the ceiling hoping to catch Varn breaking one of the rules that had been outlined in their employee handbook.  Although they had created some kind of sick obsession over something trivial, Varn would look back later in life and realize that during his three years of working in the store, A.J.'s health was the best it had been in twenty years.  It was only after Varn was finally placed on what they would call an "involuntary and indefinite leave of absence" that A.J. would have another stroke which would paralyze the right side of his body and result in his removal from the work force.  Varn's simple act of refusing to cut his hair had created enough excitement and activity in A.J.'s life that for three years his body seemed to have forgotten about its pre-existing condition.

Ernie was a simple little fellow who suffered from a severe speech impediment: he stuttered and twitched when he spoke. Benham enjoyed talking with him; so long as Ernie wasn’t excited, he could speak quite clearly. At this particular moment, Ernie was trying to free himself from a mass of seatbelts so that he could get to the next car. It was Ernie’s responsibility to climb into the backseats of all the cars and clean the rear windows.
         </p>
         <p>
“You have to be smarter than the seatbelts, retard,” taunted Jacob.
         </p>
         <p>
“DDDDDDDDDDon’t tttttttttttttttttalk ttttttttttttttttt,” stammered Ernie as his face began to turn dark red-it looked as if he wasn’t breathing.
