            Even though it’s impossible for God to exist, there exist plausible reasons for maintaining a belief in such an entity. 
            However, the majority of the human population is incapable of holding such beliefs without harming others, or themselves, 
            in some fashion. An example is cult behavior. Cults are recognized by the following traits: 
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li>
              Cults restrict the member’s access to information
            </li>
            <li>
              Cults indoctrinate members with the inimical belief that they need the cult and must remain a part of the cult in order 
              to be ‘saved’, ‘sanctified’, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
              Cults require an unquestioned allegiance to one living person, usually the pastor, father, or leader.
            </li>
            <li>
              Cults indoctrinate members to maintain a supercilious stance or even hatred toward non-members
            </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
            Ironically, many cults use the Bible to reinforce their malicious intents and beliefs.  This anachronistic text has been interpreted, 
            reinterpreted, and rewritten hundreds of times over each time in the best interest of those brainwashing, mind-raping, and 
            power-tripping fascists overseeing the changes.  Shouldn’t God’s word be, as it claims to be, everlasting, eternal, and universal? 
            Universal truths, such as <a href="BWInduction.htm" target="Main"><span class=linkTextWhite>concise, eloquent, mathematical theorems,</span></a> 
            are universally true because they can be verified by any intelligent 
            being at any time at any place in the universe independently. Could one antediluvian document written by an ancient, archaic culture 
            guide the human race in the future?

            To get a handle on what the future will be like, observe the following adroit observation that has been made by several 
            scientific cognoscenti: technology is progressing at an exponential rate. A quick, but thorough, rumination will show that 
            this statement is quite profound. 
         </p>
         <p>
            Note that any exponential process will appear slower than a linearly growing process 
            in the incipient stages, but as time progresses, the exponential process explodes into infinity from the limited perspective 
            of the linear process. Take a moment to imagine what exponential growth means to an evolutionary process. Each tier in the 
            process is used to manufacture the next, and so on exponentially. 
         </p>
         <p>
            A simple, but illustrative, example of an 
		<a href="Quantum/BWComplexExponential.htm" target="Main"><span class=linkTextWhite>exponential process</span></a>
		is that of the 
            inventor of chess and his patron, the emperor of China. When asked by the emperor what he desired as reward for his invention, 
            the inventor requested that he be given the grains of rice resulting from placing one grain on the first square, two on the 
            second, four on the third, and so on to the end of the chess board. The emperor granted the seemingly feckless request. 
         </p>
         <p>
            Through the first half of the chessboard things seemed fine, by the end of the chessboard (at the 64th square), the emperor 
            was entitled to give the inventor over 18 million trillion grains of rice. At ten grains of rice per square inch, it would 
            take a field over twice the size of the surface area of the Earth, oceans included, to yield such a crop. 
         </p>
         <p>
            Needless to say, an exponential process is nothing to sneeze at.
