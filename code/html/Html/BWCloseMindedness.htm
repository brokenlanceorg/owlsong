         How many times have you heard this term used? Did the meaning each time remain consistent? We use this term in colloquial speech, 
         we use it during debates, and we use it during arguments among other areas. But what does it <I>mean</I>? 
         Informally, we take it to imply that someone (i.e., a sentient being) is not ‘open’ to new thoughts and ideas, or that someone is 
         set in their worldview and will not expend the energy to truly evaluate another worldview. Observe that this informal definition 
         assumes the subject is a sentient being.<br><br>
         The problem with this definition is its amorphous character. The definition is still too vague for philosophical or logical use, 
         that is to say, both sides of a debate can almost always claim that the other side is being ‘close-minded’ according to this definition.<br>
         For example, side A provides three reasons that abortion is a wrong practice, while side B provides three reasons supporting 
         abortion practices. Side A is not persuaded by side B’s arguments, and accuses side B of being ‘close-minded’ because side B did not 
         fully understand or evaluate side A’s reasoning. Similarly, side B accuses side A of being ‘close-minded’ because side A was not won  
         over by side B’s arguments, and thus side A is being ‘narrow-minded’ or ‘close-minded’.<br><br>
         I propose a new definition--a rigorous definition that leaves no room for debate, a definition that is fully rooted in mathematical reasoning. 
         In <I>any</I> rational debate or argument, there are accepted definitions and axioms from which both parties work. These axioms and definitions 
         are the intersection of the two theory’s foundations. It is this intersection of the theories that must be admitted into the debate, 
         no other aspect of either theory may be admitted. For example, in a debate about Jesus Christ’s crucifixion between an Atheist and a Christian, 
         the belief that Jesus was the son of God <b>can not</b> be admitted as either a definition or an axiom because to the Atheist, the statement 
         that Jesus was/is the son of God is <b>not</b> self-evident or trivially true. It is the Christian’s job to <I>prove</I> his or her claim 
         from more basic principles (axioms) and definitions.<br>

         With this formulation, statements provable using the intersection of the formal systems (axioms together with definitions) will necessarily 
         be true within each theory. Conjectures that rely upon axioms or definitions <I>outside</I> of the intersection will obviously be 
         meaningless within the context of the other formal system. For example, consider two people Euclid and Bolyai. Euclid holds that geometry 
         is derived from the following axioms:<br>
         (1) It is possible to draw a straight line from any point to any point.<br>
         (2) It is possible to extend a finite straight line continuously in a straight line.<br>
         (3) It is possible to describe a circle with any center and distance [radius].<br>
         (4) All right angles are equal to each other.<br>
         (5) If a straight line falling on two straight lines makes the interior angles on the same side less than two right angles, 
         the two straight lines, if produced infinitely, meet on that side on which the angels are less than the two right angles.<br>
         Bolyai holds that the first four axioms are true, but he sees how the converse of axiom five could possibly be true 
         (i.e., that there can be infinitely many parallel lines to any given line). Now suppose that Euclid produces a theorem that 
         uses axiom number five in its proof, this theorem is absolutely meaningless in Bolyai’s formal system; Bolyai may have an associated 
         theorem that uses his version of the fifth axiom in its proof, but Euclid's theorem will have no meaning within the context of Bolyai's
         theory. An attempt to equate the two theorems is a futile process--they are derived from completely different axiomatic systems.<br><br>
         Thus, without restricting the argument to the intersection of the two systems, Euclid will always claim that Bolyai is being 
         ‘close-minded’ because Bolyai rejects Euclid’s theorem, and Bolyai will always claim that Euclid is being ‘close-minded’ because 
         Euclid rejects Bolyai’s analogous theorem. The axioms which Euclid and Bolyai are allowed to use in their debate is the intersection 
         of the two formal systems, which, in this case, consists of the axioms one through four.<br>
