         <span class=bodyGreenSmallJustify>Definition:</span> Two sets A and B are of the same cardinality if the elements of A can be mapped
         in a one-to-one correspondence with the elements of B.
         </p>
         <p>
         Let A be the set: {1, 2, 3, ...} and let B be the set: {1, 4, 9, ...} thus, A is the set of natural numbers A = {n : such that n is a
         natural number}, while B is the set B = { n&#178 : where n is a natural number }. Define the function f(x) that maps A into B by:
         f(x) = x&#178, where x is an element of A and f(x) is an element of B. Clearly this mapping is one-to-one, thus, the sets A and B have the
         same cardinality (the same size).

         <span class=bodyGreenSmallJustify>Definition:</span> A set is Finite if it has the same cardinality as some finite subset of the natural
         numbers.

         <span class=bodyGreenSmallJustify>Definition:</span> A set is Infinite if it has the same cardinality as the set of natural numbers.

         <span class=bodyGreenSmallJustify>Proposition:</span> The set of real numbers in the interval [0, 1] is uncountable.
         </p>
         <p>
         <span class=bodyGreenSmallJustify>Proof:</span> Note that every real number in this interval can be represented as a decimal number of the
         form: .d_1 d_2 d_3 ... Now list every possible number in this interval in the following manner:<br>
         .d_01 d_02 d_03 ...<br>
         .d_11 d_12 d_13 ...<br>
         .d_21 d_22 d_23 ...<br>
         ...<br>
         It appears that mapping 1 to the first number, 2 to the second number, and so on will lead to a one-to-one mapping with the natural numbers.
         But, as Cantor showed, form a new number d by the following: d = .(d_01 + 1) (d_12 + 1) (d_12 + 1) ... if d_xx is 9 then, (d_xx + 1) is zero.
         As can be seen, this new number uses the digits along the diagonal of our list. Now, this new number d can not be the first number on the 
         list because it differs in the first digit position by 1, and it can't be the second number on the list because it differs from that number
         by 1 in the second digit place, and it can't be the third number because it differs by 1 in the third digit place, and so on down the whole
         list. Therefore, this new number d is not on our list of all possible real numbers from 0 to 1. Therefore, since our list can not be put into
         a one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers and since the list is not finite, this list is uncountable.
