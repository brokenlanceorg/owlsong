In the seventh chapter of <i>Non Serviam</i> Dobb presents to the reader the inhabitants of the digital universum. The personoids have at their disposal a fluency of thought as well as of language, and they also have emotions. Each of them is an individual entity; their differentiation is not the mere consequence of the decisions of the creator-programmer but results from the extraordinary complexity of their internal structure. They can be very like, one to another, but never are they identical. Coming into the world, each is endowed with a “core,” a “personal nucleus,” and already possess the faculty of speech and thought, albeit in a rudimentary state. They have a vocabulary, but it is quite spare, and they have the ability to construct sentences in accordance with the rules of the syntax imposed upon them. It appears that in the future it will be possible for us not to impose upon them even these determinants, but to sit back and wait until, like a primeval human group in the course of socialization, they develop their own speech. But this direction of personetics confronts two cardinal obstacles. In the first place, the time required to await the creation of speech would have to be very long. At present, it would take twelve years, even with the maximation of the rate of intra-computer transformations (speaking figuratively and very roughly, one second of machine time corresponds to one year of human life). Secondly, and this is the greater problem, a language arising spontaneously in the “group evolution of the personoids” would be incomprehensible to us, and its fathoming would be bound to resemble the arduous taks of breaking an enigmatic code<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190;</span></span>a task made all the more difficult by the fact that such a code would not have been created by people for other people in a world shared by the decoders.

The world of the peronoids is vastly different in qualities from ours, and therefore a language suited to it would have to be far removed from any ethnic language. So, for the time being, linguistic evolution <i>ex nihilo</i> is only a dream of the personeticists.
         </p>
<p>
The personoids, when they have “taken root developmentally,” come up against an enigma that is fundamental, and for them paramount<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190;</span></span>that of their own origin. To wit, they set themselves questions<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190;</span></span>questions known to us from the history of man, from the history of his religious beliefs, philosophical inquiries, and mythic creations: Where did we come from? Why are we made thus and not otherwise? Why is it that the world we perceive has these and not other, wholly different properties? What meaning do we have for the world? What meaning does it have for us? The train of such speculations leads them ultimately, unavoidably, to the elemental questions of ontology, to the problem of whether existence came about “in and of itself,” or whether it was the product, instead, of a particular creative act<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190;</span></span>that is, whether there might not be, hidden behind it, invested with will and consciousness, purposively active, master of the situation, a Creator. It is here that the whole cruelty, the immorality of personetics manifests itself.
</p>
<p>
But before Dobb takes up, in the second half of his work, the account of these intellectual strivings<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190;</span></span>these struggles of a mentality made prey to the torment of such questions<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190;</span></span>he presents ina series of successive chapters a portrait of the “typical personoid,” its “anatomy, physiology, and psychology.”
