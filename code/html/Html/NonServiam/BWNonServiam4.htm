         <p>This model is not an accurate representation of reality, and yet one can make use of it for a period of time historically long, and with it can even achieve many practical successes<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190;</span></span>the building of machines, implements, etc. Similarly, should the personoids “incline themselves,” by choice, by and act of will, to a certain type of relation to their universum, and to that type of relation give precedence<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190;</span></span>if it is in this and only in this that they find the “essence” of their cosmos<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190;</span></span>they will enter upon a definite path of endeavors and discoveries, a path that is neither illusory nor futile. Their inclination “draws out” of the environment what best corresponds to it. What they first perceive is what they first master. For the world that surrounds them is only partially determined, only partially established in advance by the research-creator; in it, the personoids preserve a certain and by no means insignificant margin of freedom of action<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190;</span></span>action both “mental” (in the province of what they think of their own world, of how they understand it) and “real” (in the context of their “deeds”<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190;</span></span>which are not, to be sure, literally real, as we understand the term, but are not merely imagined, either). This is, in truth, the most difficult part of the exposition, and Dobb, we daresay, is not altogether successful in explaining those special qualities of personoid existence<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190;</span></span>qualities that can be rendered only by the language of the mathematics of programs and creational interventions. We must, then, take it somewhat on faith that the activity of the personoids is neither entirely free<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190;</span></span>as the space of our actions is not entirely free, being limited by the physical laws of nature<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190;</span></span>nor entirely determined<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190;</span></span>just as we are not train cares set on rigidly fixed tracks. A personoid is similar to a man in the respect, too, that man’s “secondary qualities”<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190;</span></span>colors, melodious sounds, the beauty of things<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190;</span></span>can manifest themselves only when he has ears to hear and eyes to see, but what makes possible hearing and sight has been, after all, previously given. Personoids, perceiving their environment, give it from out of themselves those experiential qualities which exactly correspond to what for us are the charms of a held landscape<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190;</span></span>except, of course, that they have been provided with purely mathematical scenery. As to “how they see it,” one can make no pronouncement, for the only way of learning the “subjective quality of their sensation” would be for one to shed his human skin and become a personoid. Personoids, one must remember, have no eyes or ears, therefore they neither see nor hear, as we understand it; in the cosmos there is no light, no darkness, no spatial proximity, no distance, no up or down; there are dimensions there, not tangible to us but to them primary, elemental; they perceive, for example<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190;</span></span>as equivalents of the components of human sensory awareness<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190;</span></span>certain changes in electrical potential.

         <p>
But these changes in potential are, for them, not something in the nature of, let us say, pressures of current but, rather, the sort of thing that , for a man, is the most rudimentary phenomenon, optical or aural<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190;</span></span>the seeing of a red blotch, the hearing of a sound, the touching of an object hard or soft. From here on, Dobb stresses, one can speak only in analogies, equivocations.
         </p>
<p>
To declare that the personoids are “handicapped” with respect to us, inasmuch as they do not see or hear as we do, is totally absurd, because with equal justice one could assert that it is we who are deprived with respect to them<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190;</span></span>unable to feel with immediacy the phenomenalism of mathematics, which, after all, we know only in a cerebral, inferential fashion. It is only through reasoning that we are in touch with mathematics, only through abstract thought that we “experience” it. Whereas the personoids <i>live</i> in it; it is their air, their earth, clouds, water and even bread<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190;</span></span>yes even food, because in a certain sense they take nourishment from it. And so they are “imprisoned,” hermetically locked inside the machine, solely from our point of view; just as they cannot work their way out to us, to the human world, so, conversely<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190;</span></span>and symmetrically<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190;</span></span>a man can in no wise enter the interior of their world, so as to exist in it and know it directly. Mathematics has become, then, in certain of its embodiments, the life-space of an intelligence so spiritualized as to be totally incorporeal, the niche and cradle of its existence, its element.

The personoids are in many respects similar to man. They are able to imagine a particular contradiction (that <b>a</b> is and that <b>not-a</b> is) but cannot bring about its realization, just as we cannot. The physics of our world, the logic of theirs, does not allow it, since logic is for the personoids’ universum the very same action-confining frame that physics is for our world. In any case<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190;</span></span>emphasizes Dobb<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190;</span></span>it is quite out of the question that we could ever fully, introspectively grasp what the psersonoids “feel” and what they “experience” as they go about their intensive tasks in their nonfinite universum. Its utter spacelessness is no prison<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190;</span></span>that is a piece of nonsense the journalist latched onto<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190;</span></span>but is, on the contrary, the guarantee of their freedom, because the mathematics that is spun by the computer generators when “excited” into activity (and what excites them thus is precisely the activity of the personoids)<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190;</span></span>that mathematics is, as it were, a self-realizing infinite field for optional actions, architectural and other labors, for exploration, heroic excursions, daring incursions, surmises. In a word: we have done the personoids no injustice by putting them in possession of precisely such and not a different cosmos. It is not in this that one finds the cruelty, the immorality of personetics.
