At present a “world” for personoid “inhabitants” can be prepared in a matter of a couple of hours. This is the time it takes to feed into the machine one of the full-fledged programs (such as BAAL 66, CREAN IV, or JAHVE 09). Dobb gives a rather cursory sketch of the beginnings of personetics, referring the reader to the historical sources; a confirmed practitioner-experimenter himself, he speaks mainly of his own work<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190;</span></span>which is much to the point, since between the English school, which Dobb represents, and the American group, at MIT, the differences are considerable, both in the area of methodology and as regards experimental goals. Dobb describes the procedure of “6 days in 120 minutes” as follows. First, one supplies the machines’s memory with a minimal set of givens; that is<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190;</span></span>to keep within a languages comprehensible to laymen<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190;</span></span>one loads its memory with substance that is “mathematical.” This substance is the protoplasm of a universum to be “habitated” by personoids. We are now able to supply the beings that will come into this mechanical, digital world<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190;</span></span>that will be carrying on an existence in it, and in it only<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190;</span></span>with an environment of nonfinite characteristics. These beings, therefore, cannot feel imprisoned in the physical sense, because the environment does not have, from their standpoint, any bounds. The medium possess only one dimension that resembles a dimension given us also<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190;</span></span>namely, that of the passage of time (duration). Their time is not directly analogous to ours, however, because the rate of its flow is subject to discretionary control on the part of the experimenter. As a rule, the rate is maximized in the preliminary phase (the so-called creation warm-up), so that our minutes correspond to whole eons in the computer, during which there takes place a series of successive reorganizations and crystallizations<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190;</span></span>of a synthetic cosmos. It is a cosmos completely spaceless, though possessing dimensions, but these dimensions have a purely mathematical, hence what one might call an “imaginary” character. They are, very simply, the consequence of certain axiomatic decisions of the programmer, and their number depends on him. If, for example, he chooses a ten-dimensionality, it will have for the structure of the world created altogether different consequences from those where only six dimensions are established. It should be emphasized that these dimensions bear no relation to those of physical space but only to the abstract, logically valid constructs made use of in systems creation.

This point, all but inaccessible to the non-mathematician, Dobb attempts to explain by adducing simple facts, the sort generally learned in school. It is possible, as we know, to construct a geometrically regular three-dimensional solid<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190;</span></span>say, a cube<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190;</span></span>which in the real world possesses a counterpart in the form of a die; and it equally possible to create geometrical solids of four, five, <i>n</i> dimensions (the four-dimensional is a tesseract). These no longer possess real counterparts, and we can see this, since in the absence of any physical dimension No. 4 there is no way to fashion genuine four-dimensional dice. Now, this distinction (between what is physically constructible and what may be made only mathematically) is, for personoids, in general nonexistent, because their world is of a purely mathematical consistency. It is built of mathematics, though the building blocks of that mathematics are ordinary, perfectly physical objects (relays, transistors, logic circuits<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190;</span></span>in a word, the whole huge network of the digital machine).
</p>

As we know from modern physics, space is not something independent of the objects and masses that are situated within it. Space is, in it existence, determined by those bodies; where they are not, where nothing is<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190;</span></span>in the material sense<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190;</span></span>there, too, space ceases, collapsing to zero. Now, the role of material bodies, which extend their “influence,” so to speak, and thereby “generate” space, is carried out in the personoid world by systems of a mathematics called into being for that very purpose. Out of all the possible “maths” that in general might be made (for example, in an axiomatic manner), the programmer, having decided upon a specific experiment, selects a particular group, which will serve as the underpinning, the “existential substrate,” the “ontological foundation” of the created universum. There is in this, Dobb believes, a striking similarity to the human world. This world of ours, after all, has “decided” upon certain forms and upon certain types of geometry that best suit it<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190;</span></span>best, since most simply (three-dimensionality, in order to remain with what one began with). This notwithstanding, we are able to picture “other worlds” with “other properties”<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190;</span></span>in the geometrical and not only in the geometrical realm. It is the same with personoids: that aspect of mathematics which the researcher has chosen as the “habitat” is for them exactly what for us is the “real-world base” in which we live, and live perforce. And, like us, the personoids are able to “picture” worlds of different fundamental properties.
