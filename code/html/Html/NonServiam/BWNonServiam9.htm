Dobb considers such reasoning sophistry, because as to who created whom, and who confined whom existentially, there can be no argument. Dobb himself belongs to that group which advocates the principle of absolute nonintervention<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190;</span></span>“noncontact”<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190;</span></span>with the personoids. They are the behaviorists of personetics. Their desire is to observe synthetic beings of intelligence, to listen in on their speech and thoughts, to record their actions and their pursuits, but never to interfere with these. This method is already developed and has a technology of its own<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190;</span></span>a set of instruments whose procurement presented difficulties that seemed all but insurmountable only a few years ago. The idea is to hear, to understand<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190;</span></span>in short, to be a constantly eavesdropping witness<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190;</span></span>but at the same time to prevent one’s “monitoring” from disturbing in any way the world of the personoids. Now in the planning stage at MIT are programs (APHRON II and EROT) that will enable the personoids<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190;</span></span>who are currently without gender<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190;</span></span>to have “erotic contacts,” make possible what corresponds to fertilization, and give them the opportunity to multiply “sexually.” Dobb makes clear that he is no enthusiast of these American projects. His work, as described in <i>Non Serviam</i>, is aimed in an altogether different direction. Not without reason has the English school of personetics been called “the philosophical Polygon” and “the theodicy lab.” With these descriptions we come to what is probably the most significant and, certainly, the most intriguing part of the book under discussion<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190;</span></span>the last part, which justifies and explains it peculiar title.

Dobb gives an account of his own experiment, in progress now for eight years without interruption. Of the creation itself he makes only brief mention; it was fairly ordinary duplicating of functions typical of the program JAVE VI, with slight modifications. He summarizes the results of “tapping” this world, which he himself created and whose development he continues to follow. He considers this tapping to be unethical, and even, at times, a shameful practice. Nevertheless, he carries on with his work, professing a belief in the necessity, for science, of conducting such experiments <i>also</i><span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190;</span></span>experiments that can in no way be justified on moral<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190;</span></span>or, for that matter, on any other non-knowledge-advancing<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190;</span></span>grounds. The situation, he says, has come to the point where the old evasions of the scientists will not do. Once cannot affect a fine neutrality and conjure away an uneasy conscience by using, for example, the rationalization worked out by vivisectionists<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190;</span></span>that it is not in creatures of full-dimensional consciousness, not in sovereign beings that one is causing suffering or only discomfort. In the personoid experiments we are accountable twofold, because we create and then enchain the creation in the schema of our laboratory procedures. Whatever we do and however we explain our action, there is no longer an escape from full accountability.
