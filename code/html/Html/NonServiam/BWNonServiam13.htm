NAAD asks if God may not actually want there to be a dichotomy between logic and belief in Him: perhaps the act of faith should be precisely a resignation of logic in favor of a total trust.
</p>
<p>
ADAN: Once we allow the logical reconstruction of something (a being, a theodicy, a theogony, and the like) to have internal self-contradiction, it obviously becomes possible to prove absolutely anything, whatever one pleases. Consider how the matter lies. We are speaking of creating someone and of endowing him with a particular logic, and then demanding that this same logic be offered up in sacrifice to a belief in the Maker of all things. If this model itself is to remain non-contradictory, it calls for the application, in the form of a metalogic, of a totally different type of reasoning from that which is natural to the logic of the one created. If that does not reveal the outright imperfections of the Creator, then it reveals a quality that I would call mathematical inelegance<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190;</span></span>a <i>sui generic</i> unmethodicalness (incoherence) of the creative act.
</p>
<p>
NAAD persists: Perhaps God acts thus, desiring precisely to remain inscrutable to His creation<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190;</span></span>i.e., non-reconstructible by the logic with which He has provided it. He demands, in short, the supremacy of faith over logic.
</p>
         <p>
ADAN answers him: I follow you. This is, of course, possible, but even if such were the case, a faith that proves incompatible with logic presents an exceedingly unpleasant dilemma of a moral nature.

<p>
For then it is necessary at some point in one’s reasonings to suspend them and give precedence to an unclear supposition<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190;</span></span>in other words, to set the supposition above logical certainty. This is to be done in the name of unlimited trust; we enter, here, into a <i>circulus vitiosus</i>, because the postulated existence of that in which it behooves one now to place one’s trust is the product of a line of reasoning that was, in the first place, <i>logically correct</i>; thus arises a logical contradiction, which, for some, takes on a positive value and is called the Mystery of God. Now, from the purely constructional point of view such a solution is shoddy, and from the moral point of view questionable, because Mystery may satisfactorily be founded upon infinity (infiniteness, after all, is a characteristic of our world), but the maintaining and the reinforcing of it through internal paradox is, by any architectural criterion, perfidious. The advocates of theodicy are in general not aware that his is so, because to certain parts of their theodicy they continue to apply ordinary logic and to other parts, not. What I wish to say is this, that if one believes in contradiction, (Professor Dobbs footnote: <i>Credo quia absurdum est</i>>) one should then believe <i>only</i> in contradiction, and not at the same time still in some noncontradiction (i.e., in logic) in some other area. If, however, such a curious dualism is insisted upon ( that the temporal is always subject to logic, the transcendental only fragmentarily), then on thereupon obtains a model of Creation as something that is, with regard to logical correctness, “patched,” and it is no longer possible for one to postulate its perfections. One comes inescapably to the conclusion that perfection is a thing that must be logically patched.
