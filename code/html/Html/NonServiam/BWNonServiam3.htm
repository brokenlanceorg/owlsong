Dobb presents his subject using the method of success approximations and recapitulations; that which we have outlined above, and which corresponds roughly to the first two chapters of his book, in the subsequent chapters undergoes partial revocreation<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190;</span></span>through complication. It is not really the case, the author advises us, that the personoids simply come upon a ready-made, fixed, frozen sort of world in its irrevocably final form; what the world will be like in it specificities depends on them, and this to a growing degree as their own activeness increases, as the “exploratory initiative” develops. Nor does the likening of the universum of the personoids to a world in which phenomena exist only to the extent that its inhabitants observe them provide an accurate image of the conditions. Such a comparison, which is to be found in the works of Sainter and Hughs, Dobb considers an “idealist deviation”<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190;</span></span>a homage that personetics has rendered to the doctrine, so curiously and so suddenly resurrected, of Bishop Berkeley. Sainter maintained that the personoids would know their wold after the fashion of a Berkeleyan being, which is not in a position to distinguish “<i>esse</i>” from “<i>percipi</i>”<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190;</span></span>to wit, it will never discover the difference between the thing perceived and that which occasions the perception in a way objective and independent of the one perceiving. Dobb attacks this interpretation of the matter with a passion. <i>We</i>, the creators of their world, know perfectly well that what is perceived by them indeed exists; it exists inside the computer, independent of them<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190;</span></span>though, granted, solely in the manner of mathematical objects.

And there are further clarifications. The personoids arise germinally by virtue of the program; they increase at a rate imposed by the experimenter<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190;</span></span>a rate only such as the latest technology of information processing, operating at near-light speeds, permits. The mathematics that is to be the “existential residence” of the personoids does not await them in full readiness but is still “in wraps,” so to speak<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190;</span></span>unarticulated, suspended, latent<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190;</span></span>because it represents only a set of certain prospective chances, of certain pathways contained in appropriately programmed subunits of the machine. These subunits, or generators, in and of themselves contribute nothing; rather, a specific type of personoid activity serves as a triggering mechanism, setting in motion a production process that will gradually augment and define itself; in other worlds, the world surrounding these beings takes on an unequivocalness only in accordance with their own behavior. Dobb tries to illustrate this concept with recourse to the following analogy. A man may interpret the real world in a variety of ways. He may devote particular attention<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190;</span></span>intense scientific investigation<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190;</span></span>to certain facets of that world, and the knowledge he acquires then casts its own special light on the remaining portions of the world, those not considered in his priority-setting research. If first he diligently takes up mechanics, he will fashion for himself a mechanical model of the world and will see the Universe as a gigantic and perfect clock that in its inexorable movement proceeds from the past to a precisely determined future.
