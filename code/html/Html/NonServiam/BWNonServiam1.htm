           The following is, in my humble opinion, one of the greatest short stories ever written.

Professor Dobb’s book is devoted to personetics, which the Finish philosopher Eino Kaikki has called “the cruelest science man ever created.” Dobb, one of the most distinguished personeticists today, shares this view. One cannot escape the conclusion, he says, that personetics is, in its application, immoral; we are dealing, however, with a type of pursuit that is, though counter to the principles of ethics, also of practical necessity to us. There is no way, in the research, to avoid its special ruthlessness, to avoid doing violence to one’s natural instincts, and if nowhere else it is here that the myth of the perfect innocence of the scientist as a seeker of facts is exploded. We are speaking of a discipline, after all, which, with only a small amount of exaggeration, for emphasis, has been called “experimental theogony.” Even so, this reviewer is struck by the fact that when the press played up the thing, nine years ago, public opinion was stunned by the personetic disclosures. One would have thought that in this day and age nothing could surprise us. The centuries rang with the echo of the feat of Columbus, whereas the conquering of the Moon in the space of a week was received by the collective consciousness as a thing practically humdrum. And yet the birth of personetics proved to be a shock.

The name combines Latin and Greek derivatives: “persona” and “genetic”<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190;</span></span>“genetic” in the sense of formation, or creation. The field is a recent offshoot of the cybernetics and psychonics of the eighties, crossbred with applied intellectronics. Today everyone knows of personetics; the man in the street would say, if asked, that it is the artificial production of intelligent beings<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190;</span></span>an answer not wide of the mark, to be sure, but not quite getting to the heart of the matter. To date we have nearly a hundred personetic programs. Nine years ago identity schemata were being developed<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190;</span></span>primitive cores of the “linear” type<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190;</span></span>but even that generation of computers, today of historical value only, could net yet provide a field for the true creation of personoids.

The theoretical possibility of creating sentience was divined some time ago, by Norbert Wiener, as certain passages of his last book, <i>God and Golem</i>, bear witness. Granted, he alluded to it in that half-facetious manner typical of him, but underlying the facetiousness were fairly grim premonitions. Wiener, however, could not have foreseen the turn that things would take twenty years later. The worst came about<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190;</span></span>in the words of Sir Donald Acker<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#190;</span></span>when at MIT “the inputs were shorted to the outputs.”
