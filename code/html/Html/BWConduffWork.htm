            [All the time that has been wasted... ]
         </span><br>
         <p>
            I've spent days throughout my life wondering how mankind has
            made it this far. I was raised in a christian household as a child; I was taught the morals and laws
            of Judaeo-Christiantiy and all that it entailed. I was schooled and disciplined by christians during
            my developing years; I saw the hypocrisy and self-deceit practiced by my mentors in church and 
            school alike. I learned that children with no means, irregularities, were astrocized by these groups
            and the members within. Through the years, I have come to realize and accept the fallacy that is 
            their religion--a religion that is set apart by a ridiculous notion of 'love' that has always then been
            perverted.
         </p>
         <p>
            Fear mongering and hatred is needed for the religion to have thrived throughout the ages. Old gods of
            the past centuries and milleniums come and go, they are born and then they die. Gods did not create
            men, men have always created their own gods. The gods of the past are either dead or have been
            bastardized. The modern day religions, and their gods, will find the same fate.

            I look at the history of my own childhood religion and marvel at the brutality it has caused. From the
            blood-baths of the young and old in the Christian crusades, to the elitist stuffing-outs of the Spanish
            Inquisition, to the Salem witch trials. 
         </p>
         <p>
            In Salem, the 'witches' were burned, tortured, incarcerated,
            the 'witches' were nothing more than young girls that tempted the carnal nature of the townsmen.
         </p>
         <p>
            Jealous wives and self-righteous clergymen brought the girls to prison or death in the name of
            Jesus Christ. Was this the work of god or man? This is the way it always has been.  
            Man has always created and interpreted his god's will to fit his own desires and needs. 
            That's the trouble with these idealistic religions of the present day. Man's ego and natural 
            desire will will-out in the end.
