In analyzing the efficiency of Newton's method, I thought it would be advantageous to "see" how well Newton's method works on certain functions by creating an image with differing colors indicating how well the algorithm worked in various areas of the function's domain. To do this, I mapped the imaginary plane to the computer screen, and then took each pixel, or point in the complex plane, as the initial point and applied Newton's method to the wave equation. The wave equation turns up in many areas of mathematics including thermodynamics, and quantum physics. For each pixel, I counted the number of iterations Newton's method required to solve the function. I then used this number as an index into a palette of colors and then color-coded that pixel accordingly.

         <p>
Interestingly, after completing this process for all the pixels, a beautifully intricate pattern emerges. And true to fractal geometry, the pattern is self-similar on all scales&#9472that is to say, regardless of the scale used (zoom in closely, or zoom out), <a href="../BWFractal.htm" target="Main"><span class=linkTextWhite>beautiful and complex patterns</span></a> can be discovered. These patterns make up the background sky and "sunset" in the image.

The nebulae and the four spheres were computed using <a href="../BWFuzzy1.htm" target="Main"><span class=linkTextWhite>fuzzy logic.</span></a> Like 
<a href="../neural/BWNeural1.htm" target="Main"><span class=linkTextWhite>neural networks,</span></a> fuzzy logic is essentially a product of cognitive science. In an effort to model human reasoning, <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~zadeh/" target="Main"><span class=linkTextWhite>Lotfi Zadeh</span></a> discovered what has become known as fuzzy logic. To accomplish this, Zadeh utilized multivalent logic systems. In traditional Boolean logic, there are only two truth values, true or false. In a multivalent system, there can be many truth values, and in fuzzy logic, there can be an infinite number of truth values.
         </p>
         <p>
Using this multivalent system, fuzzy logic works by creating rule sets. These rule sets can then be used to control dynamical systems; for example, subway trains in Tokyo are controlled using fuzzy logic systems. The fuzzy logic system's rule set could contain rules such as: "if the car is going too fast, then slow down," or "if the car has a long way to go to the next stop, then speed up." The beauty of fuzzy logic lies in its ability to understand these rules and how to adjust the system in proper response.
