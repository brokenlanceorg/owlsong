As humans, we can repeat this process recursively as the association game: think of an input pattern, say, 'shoelaces.' What's the first thing that comes to mind? Suppose it's 'shoes;' now, given the pattern or idea of 'shoes,' what comes to mind? Perhaps 'feet,' now what comes to mind? And so on. This process can be performed on neural networks as well, and I wanted to know how the neural network would perform. Would the network settle down to one memory or keep bouncing around to different memories as humans respond?

As the foreground image demonstrates, the network kept bouncing around to different, yet related, memories. Interestingly, the image turned out remarkably similar to a landscape replete with grass and a blue lake that has an alien red blob rising from its depths.

The background sky was computed using <a href="../BWNewton.htm" target="Main"><span class=linkTextWhite>Newton's method</span></a> for finding the solutions to differentiable functions. Shortly after Isaac Newton discovered Calculus, he used the new powerful mathematics to solve any equation that has at least one derivative.

Geometrically, the method works as follows: pick any point in the function's domain as the initial 'guess' at the solution. At this point, compute the derivative to construct a tangent line to the curve. Provided this point wasn't a critical point, (i.e., the derivative is non-zero), this tangent line will cross the x-axis. Now repeat the process with this new point where the tangent intersects the x-axis. Amazingly, repeating this process yields a sequence of numbers that converge to the nearest solution point (the point where the function equals zero&#9472the root). So, given any error tolerance, a solution will be found.

Finding the solution points of functions pervades nearly any mathematical analysis. From calculating the most efficient route an aircraft flies, to determining the best selling price of a security or commodity in a particular economic model, to simulating a nuclear explosion on Cray supercomputers, finding optimal solutions to difficult problems often comes down to finding the zeros of certain functions&#9472and that is what Newton's method accomplishes.
