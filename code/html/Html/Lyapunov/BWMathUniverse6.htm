Also similar to neural networks, fuzzy logic excels where traditional methods break down. As stated earlier, Newton's method breaks down if the point used in the algorithm happens to be on, or very close to, a point where the function's derivative is zero. To get around this problem, I implemented a fuzzy logic system in C++ that finds the solution points to functions. Unlike Newton's method, the fuzzy logic method didn't need to compute the derivative of the function, so the function under scrutiny need not be differentiable.

Since fuzzy logic systems are heuristic, qualifying their efficiency and performance is cumbersome using traditional mathematical analysis. To determine how efficient the fuzzy logic method was, I used the same procedure as with Newton's method: pick a point and count the number of iterations the algorithm takes to solve the function, then color-code that pixel accordingly. Using this method, the nebula region and the four spheres were computed. However, instead of using the wave equation, I used the trigonometric tangent function.

The lighter areas indicate the algorithm had a more difficult time solving the tangent function as compared to the darker areas. As with the images that composed the background sky, each sphere image is a subset of the complex (imaginary) plane. In general, the fuzzy logic algorithm was slower than Newton's method; however, the fuzzy algorithm didn't suffer from ill-behaved, or non-differentiable functions.

Once all the images were computed, I then combined them all into a single image using a basic image-manipulation software tool. The fuzzy logic spheres actually began as square images (as stated, they were complex planes), from which I then cut out circles and added a fade effect to illicit a three-dimensional look.

The most fascinating aspect of these images is that they are the result of pure mathematics. So, in a sense, they exist in an objective realm apart from the physical universe waiting to be discovered and explored using reason and mathematical analysis.
