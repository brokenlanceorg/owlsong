Every object and every pixel in the image was computed mathematically; there was little human intervention. The image consists of four principle structures: the foreground landscape, the background "sky," the nebula pervading the background sky, and finally the four spheres (two in the upper left-hand corner, one setting behind the horizon, and one in the bottom-right hand corner).

Our brains are comprised of roughly 100 billion inter-connected specialized cells called neurons. Compared to the complexity of the brain, individual neurons are relatively simple even though they engender the vast complexity of the brain. The average neuron receives electrical impulses from other neurons through connections called dendrites. If this input impulse is above a certain threshold, the neuron will output its own output impulse down its axon, which connects to other neurons in the brain. The behavior is easily simulated on a computer as demonstrated by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts in the 1940's.

Because of today's fast and cheap microprocessors, neural networks are only now being exploited. Neural networks are extremely adept at pattern recognition, and are far superior to previous attempts at pattern recognition; as a consequence, robust solutions to such problems as speech recognition, artificial speech production, face and image recognition, etc., abound.
