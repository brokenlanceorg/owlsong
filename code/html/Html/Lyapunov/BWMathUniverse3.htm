I implemented a neural network in the C++ programming language and trained it to behave like a <a href="../neural/BWCellularAutomata1.htm" target="Main"><span class=linkTextWhite>Rule 110 cellular automaton.</span></a> The discovery of cellular automata is generally accredited to the gifted mathematician and genius John Von Neumann. In the 1980's, Stephen Wolfram, a child prodigy who published his first paper on quantum mechanics at age 15 and the inventor of the sophisticated mathematical modeling software, <a href="http://www.wolfram.com" target="Main"><span class=linkTextWhite>Mathematica,</span></a> began publishing papers on one-dimensional cellular automata. In Wolfram's numbering scheme, the 110th two-color, one-dimensional, cellular automata turned out to be equivalent to a <a href="../neural/BWTuring1.htm" target="Main"><span class=linkTextWhite>Universal Turing Machine.</span></a>

<a href="../neural/BWTuring1.htm" target="Main"><span class=linkTextWhite>Turing machines</span></a>, discovered by the eminent mathematician Alan Turing (who helped break the Nazi codes during World War II), are abstract computers; in fact, today's modern computers are but a subset of Turing machines. One of Turing's most prodigious accomplishments was his proof that a certain type of his Turing machines, known as Universal Turing Machines, can compute anything that can be computed.          </p>

This is a very powerful statement considering how simple Turing machines are, (a Turing machine is nothing more than a device that can read or write only a zero or a one on an infinite, movable tape). Anything that has been computed, or anything that will ever be computed, such as an indistinguishable-from-life virtual reality simulation in the far future can be computed by a Turing machine.
         </p>
         <p>
Thus, by constructing a neural network that mimics the rule 110 cellular automata, which is equivalent to a universal Turing machine, the neural network can compute anything that can be computed, that is to say, the neural network is a universal computer.

In investigating this powerful, yet simple, neural network, I wanted to see how stable the network was under recursion. Neural networks are similar to our brains in that if you give it an input pattern, it will respond with an output pattern (or memory, for instance).          </p>
