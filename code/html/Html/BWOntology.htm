            This essay is, for the general audience, the most important section of the website because it serves to answer the conspicuous
            question about these webpages: "why does all this matter?". Mathematical logic not only gives us cellular phones, particle 
            accelerators, quantum mechanical computers, etc., but it can also answer questions that have once been thought to be outside the 
            demesne of science, as will be seen....

            What is ‘God’? We pray to him, to her, to it. We write many a treatise about it’s abilities, we argue it’s qualities, but what 
            is ‘God’? The perceptive reader will note that in a question such as ‘What is God?’ there is a tacit assumption that this being 
            called ‘God’ actually exists because of the inveterate concept ‘God’. However, once the term ‘God’ is defined, the question of its 
            existence can then be addressed. And what is meant by the term ‘exist’? In this context, the term ‘exist’ is meant in the manner 
            of science, that is, in the same way that electrons have been proven to exist, in the same manner that gravity has been proven to 
            exist, in the same sense that liquid water exists, etc. Now, this diversion leads yet to another: what is meant by ‘proven’ or 
            ‘proof’. Essentially, a proof is a concise restatement of a logical argument whose conclusion is inevitable and incontrovertible. 
            Thus, a proof can be understood by anyone, at anytime, in anyplace. For more information on the notion of mathematical proof, 
            read about what it <a href="BWProofs.htm" target="Main"><span class=linkTextWhite>means to prove something.</span></a>

            Before any rational dialog can ensue, an accepted definition of ‘God’ must be set forth.  The following definition is taken 
            directly from the Southern Baptist Convention’s statement of faith: “There is one and only one living and true God. 
            He is an intelligent, spiritual, and personal Being, the Creator, Redeemer, Preserver, and Ruler of the universe. 
            God is infinite in holiness and all other perfections. God is all powerful and all knowing; and His perfect knowledge 
            extends to all things, past, present, and future, including the future decisions of His free creatures.” 
            Similar definitions of God have been used by theologians and philosophers for centuries-essentially, 
            God is omniscient, omnipotent, omnibenevolent, and perfect. These same theologians have put forth mendacious proofs 
            of God’s existence, consider the five proofs of St. Aquinas: 
         </p>
         <p>
            1. The "unmoved mover" argument. We know that there is a motion in the world; whatever is in motion is moved by another thing; 
            this other thing also must be moved by something; to avoid an infinite regression, we must posit a "first mover," which is God.
         </p>
         <p>
            2. The "nothing is caused by itself" argument. For example, a table is brought into being by a carpenter, who is caused by 
            his parents. Again, we cannot go on to infinity, so there must be a first cause, which is God.
