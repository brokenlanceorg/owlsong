         <p>
            The Genetic Algorithm is a specific problem-solving technique found in the more general field of Evolutionary Computing. 
            Evolutionary Computing is becoming an increasingly broad discipline, which is beyond the scope of this paper; 
            here, the focus will be on the Genetic Algorithm.
         </p>
         <p>
            The Genetic Algorithm takes it principles from Darwinian Evolution: individual members of the population reproduce and 
            through the process of mutation and selection, each member of the population ameliorates, or becomes better suited to the 
            environment in which it lives. The process of evolution can be very robust; it is because of evolution that the AIDS virus 
            is so difficult to combat, it is because of evolution that extremely virulent strains of influenza arise, and so on.

         <p>
            In 1963, Ingo Rechenberg developed, more thoroughly, the concept of evolutionary computing. He received his doctorate in 1970 
            based on this work. His work <i>“Evolution Strategies”</i> describes his ideas in more detail. The advent of the modern form of the 
            Genetic Algorithm is accredited to John Holland. Published in 1975, his book <i>“Adaptation in Natural and Artificial Systems”</i> 
            founds the Genetic Algorithm on firm statistical footing. In the book, he proves his “schema” theorem. Schema is used to refer 
            to similarity template used to describe all strings that contained a given building block or set of building blocks.

         <p>
            The ideas behind the Genetic Algorithm are simple (though they wouldn’t have been so simple 100 years ago due to the ‘contentious’ 
            nature of evolution).
