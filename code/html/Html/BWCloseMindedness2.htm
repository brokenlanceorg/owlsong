         Now the term ‘open-mindedness’ may be defined. It is known that Euclid’s fifth axiom cannot be deduced from the previous four axioms, 
         and likewise for Bolyai’s fifth axiom. When it can not be proved that either system is inconsistent, both parties must be ‘open-minded’ 
         to the truth of the other’s formal system. Thus, when Euclid’s axiomatic formulation can not be shown to be inconsistent, Bolyai must 
         be ‘open-minded’ to the logical consistency of Euclid’s theory. Likewise, when Bolyai’s axiomatic formulation appears not to be inconsistent, 
         Euclid must be ‘open-minded’ to the logical consistency of Bolyai’s theory. It is easy to see that if Euclid claims that Bolyai’s 
         theory is inconsistent (or not true) without giving proof, Euclid is then being ‘close-minded’, and similarly for Bolyai.<br><br>
         There are indeed other subtle ways to be ‘close-minded’. To illustrate these simple concepts, consider the following. Suppose that two 
         people, person A and person B, agree upon modern analysis (their formal systems are commensurate). They are debating the truth of 
         Goldbach’s conjecture. Christian Goldbach, in a 1742 letter to Leonhard Euler, made a conjecture (an unproven yet supposedly provable statement) 
         that has become known as Goldbach’s conjecture. The modern form of the conjecture is as follows: it is possible to write every 
         even number greater than 2 as the sum of two prime numbers. For the past 250 years, the greatest mathematicians have tried to 
         prove this conjecture and all have failed. Now, it may be the case that this conjecture is true, that is, all even numbers greater 
         than 2 can be written as the sum of two prime numbers.

         It may also be the case that this conjecture is not true, that is, <b>not</b> 
         all even numbers greater than 2 can be written as the sum of two prime numbers. Since the conjecture has not been proven, persons 
         A and B must be <I>open-minded</I> as to whether or not the conjecture is mendacious. Person A would be <I>close-minded</I> if he 
         or she held, without proof, that the conjecture is either true or false. So, if person A said ‘I know that Goldbach’s conjecture is 
         false beyond any doubt, I can’t prove it, but I know that it is false’, then person A is ipso facto being close-minded because his 
         claim has not been proven thus the conjecture could still be true or false. Once Goldbach’s conjecture is proven to be true or false, 
         we must accept that proof because that is the purpose of a proof--a theorem settles once and for all time the truth of a proposition. 
         More generally, once <I>any</I> proposition is proven to be true, we all must accept that theorem. For example, suppose that tomorrow 
         a mathematical genius publishes a paper that proves Goldbach’s conjecture. Further suppose that person A still claims that Goldbach’s 
         conjecture is false, then person A is again being close-minded. Person A is being close-minded because although the conjecture was 
         proven and made a theorem (correctly we suppose), person A still <I>believes</I> that Goldbach’s conjecture is false.<br><br>
         The methodology I have given for defining 'close-mindedness' (and equivalently 'open-mindedness') is a rigorous and
         straightforward calculation using the venerated laws of logic.
