            To be sure, there can be situations in which sets of properties A and B satisfy the above, yet the properties B are not 
            <I>fully</I> determined by the properties A. Consider then another definition: a set of properties B supervenes on its 
            set of low-level properties A if and only if no other set C of properties is equivalent with respect to its low-level 
            A properties while differing from the B properties. That is, the properties A, on which B supervenes, are the unique 
            such properties that determine B completely. For example, consider a clock. A clock can be broken down its constituent parts, 
            and each discrete part can be understood completely with respect to its function. Once composed again, the clock can be 
            understood as the combined activity of all it parts. The most complex human creation, the computer, can be understood 
            reductively in the very same manner; although the description and explanation may be very complex, the description and 
            explanation can be performed nonetheless.
         </p>
         <p>
            The above notion of supervenience is usually employed by reductionists to combat those claiming emergence. On the façade, 
            it seems that brain state <I>must</I> depend upon brain function, for otherwise, some sort of duality (which is no longer tenable) is assumed. 
         </p>

            Observe that when one talks of ‘emergent properties’, one is speaking of actual ‘things’, that is to say, there are extant 
            entities in the universe worthy of the appellation ‘emergent’. Moreover, for any object in the universe, causality is inherent. 
            General Relativity and 
            <a href="BWQuantum.htm" target="Main"><span class=linkTextWhite>Quantum Mechanics</span></a> show indubitably that cause, 
            effect, matter, and energy are intricately entangled;

         <p>
            thus, when matter is present, energy is present, when cause is present, effect is present (in possibly unconventional and unintuitive ways). 
            Naturally then, a definition about emergence should utilize causality. Two conjoint causes are said to produce an effect. 
            For example, two moving billiard balls on a billiards table converge together to produce the effect that is accurately described 
            by Newtonian Mechanics; atoms in quartz bond themselves in a crystalline lattice to produce the macrophysical effect we call a crystal. 
            Define emergence as the resulting behavior if removing any causal conjuncts from a physical system prevents the remaining conjuncts 
            from contributing their full effects to the system.
         </p>
         <p>
   The above definition implies that the system’s holistic configuration has an effect on the individual particles, and the individual particles exert an effect on the system as a whole, which has an effect on the particles, which has an effect…. instantaneously. An example of this kind of behavior is the notorious three-body problem, whose solution doesn’t exist. Thus, the system as a whole contains something more than the sum of its parts. Looking at the situation from an information-theoretic point of view, perhaps this ‘something’ is information; suppose that the system is made of five parts and each part contains one bit of information, yet the system as a whole contains seven, (or equivalently more than five), bits of information.
