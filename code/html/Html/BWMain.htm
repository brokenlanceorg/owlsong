The oftentimes onerous evolution of humankind is diverging. There exist two paths by which one may go by. 
The first of these paths is the known reality to which are fastened such trammels as DVDs, CDs, Stocks, Bonds, Bands, Music, 
Singing, Song, Poetry, Words, Books, Paper, Trees, Flowers, Bees, Birds, Flight, Aircraft, Spacecraft, Space, Space-time, Stars,
Nebula, Quasars, Black Holes, Singularities, Synchronicities, Superstitions, Beliefs, Faiths, Religions, Cathedrals, Chapels, Homes, 
Driveways, Cars, Motorcycles, Bicycles, Wheels, Gears, Sears, JCPenneys, Macys, Fifth Avenue, Times Square, Columbus Circle, Navel Vessels, Navigation  …. 
Abstract Reality is the second of these paths. Thoughts, Dreams, Mathematics - these are examples of abstraction to which humankind must 
aspire and eventually transcend. It is imperative that humankind achieves this state of transcendence to avoid extinction and to enjoy enlightenment. 
In the most optimistic case, humankind’s lethargy will become exigency when the sun’s thermonuclear thirst has consumed all of its hydrogen and helium. 
Nothing short of terraforming and colonization of far-removed worlds will resolve this quandary. On the down side, scientists know of 6 
mass extinctions that have wiped the planet up to 96% void of life. Furthermore, scientists estimate that mass extinctions occur on average 
every 26 million years. Between now and the nova, roughly forty mass extinctions are predicted. By instinct and a perforce propensity to survive, 
humankind strives to continue, continues to evolve, evolves to continue.

This evolutionary mandala discovered by the <a href="BWGenetic1.htm" target="Main"><span class=linkTextWhite>Genetic Algorithm</span></a> 
of natural selection must be ameliorated to ensure future existence. 
Myths, folktales, and specious spiritual judgements no longer impel the artifice forward, but rather ensnarl it in a wicked web of deception. 
Pellucid is the solution: Abstract Thought. What humankind has achieved has been earned by way of applied abstraction. 
Consider the stanchion of mathematics in all its glory from Boolean Logic to 
<a href="BWFuzzy1.htm" target="Main"><span class=linkTextWhite>Fuzzy Logic</span></a>, from Analytic Geometry to Fractal Geometry, 
from Vector Algebra to Functional Analysis, from Calculus to Differential Topography. It is from some form of mathematics that we have 
transportation machinery, television, radio, in short, all things and objects; it is from some form of mathematics that we have theories -- 
theories of cognitive processes, theories of space-time, theories of extinction, etc. It is from mathematics that we have virtually 
everything the modern person uses. Mathematics is thus an example, par excellence, of ambient abstraction. 
Ambient abstraction will be the future’s venerated icon to which we will someday attribute our very existence. 
Provided humankind chooses the correct path both culturally and biologically, we will owe to ambient abstraction such accomplishments 
as the complete harnessing of nuclear and quantum powers, colonization of the galaxy, and perhaps even subjective immortality. 
Until then, in the depth of our somnolence, some of us will be Nostalgic for the Abstract.
