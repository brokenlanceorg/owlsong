           As you can see from figure 4, B's surface of simultaneity coincides with the event of B 
           crossing A's path. However, in A's frame of reference, the surface of simultaneity is a 
           horizontal line. Thus, according to A, the event at the blue dot didn't happen until the time
           marked t0, but according to B, the event occurred exactly when B crossed A's path! So, according
           to B's watch, the event occurred at time t`=0, while in A's frame of reference, the event occurred
           at time t=t0. To calculate this time difference we need to determine time t0.
         </p>

           Notice that if we draw two lines (the light blue lines in figure 5), the resulting triangles are
           congruent. Specifically, the angles a and b are equivalent (the proof of this fact will be omitted, 
           but it's a straightforward proof nonetheless). Since the angles are equivalent, we can write
           tan(b) = tan(a) => t0 / x1 = x0 / t1. Now, observe that x0 is B's position, which is a function
           of time, namely: x0 = v * t1, where v is B's velocity (assuming a constant velocity). Substituting
           this in for x0 we have: t0 / x1 = v * t1 / t1 => t0 / x1 = v. Multiplying through by x1 gives:
           t0 = v * x1; so t0, the time at which A measured the event to have occurred, is A's measurement
           of the distance of the event (x1) scaled by B's velocity.

           This implies that there is no such thing as absolute space and absolute time, they are relative
           to particular frames of reference! In this scenario, to A's frame of reference, B's time contracted,
           while to B's frame of reference, A's distance to the event dilated. One interesting result is
