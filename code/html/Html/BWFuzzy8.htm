           Suppose x = a person who stands 67 inches as before, then the antecedent 'tall'
           yields a value of 0.791666, next, we find where the set 'heavy' is equivalent to 0.791666 (which is the 
           inverse of the <span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">m</span></span>Heavy(x) function): z = (0.791666 - (-70/130)) * 130 = 
           172.91658 lbs. So, according to our model, if someone is 5 feet 7 inches tall, we can expect them to weigh roughly 172 pounds.
         </p>
         <p>
           Needless to say, this was a trivial example, in general there will be more than one consequent set, whereas above,
           we only had one consequent set 'heavy'. In the example above, it is evident how to 'defuzzify' the fuzzy 
           consequent set into a single crisp value, but what about the situation when several fuzzy consequent sets
           contribute to the final output value? Suppose the rule base consisted of rules such as:
         </p>
         <p>
           if x1 is Y1 then z is Z1<br>
           if x2 is Y2 then z is Z2<br>
           if x3 is Y3 then z is Z3<br>
         </p>
         <p>
           The question then is how do we combine Z1, Z2, and Z3 into a single value?
         </p>

         <p>
           The following is done for the general case. Each consequent fuzzy set is scaled according to it's antecedent's
           truth value. The set of consequent sets are either intersected or unioned, or both, to produce an irregular
           consequent set. Then, from this set of sets, a defuzzifying algorithm is applied to generate a crisp value.
           There are many different algorithms for defuzzifying a fuzzy set, here are a few:
         </p>
         <ul>
           <li>
             Composite Moments: This method calculates the center of mass for the resulting irregular set. To accurately
             compute this value, the integral calculus must be brought to bear--but this calculation is rather costly.
             An efficient approximation is given by: c = sum(i=0, n){ d_i m(d_i) } / sum(i=0, n) { m(d_i) }, where d_i
             is the ith domain point in the set, and n is the number of domain points to sample. 
           </li>
         </ul>
