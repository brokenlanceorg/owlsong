           In Essence, fuzzy logic is a generalization of Aristotelian or Boolean logic. Within the context of Boolean logic,
           a proposition is either true or false. For example, the proposition: "42 is an even number" is a bivalent
           statement--it is either true or it is false, i.e., the number '42' is either a member of the
           set of even numbers, or it is not a member of the set of even numbers.
         </p>
         <p>
           Fuzzy logic extrapolates the idea of set membership from bi-valence to multi-valence. In his seminal paper 
           "Fuzzy Sets" [1965], Lotfi A. Zadeh introduced the notion of degree of set membership. To do this, he
           used 'linguistic variables' that capture the fuzziness inherit in their meaning. For example, the statement:
           "I am short", is fuzzy or ambiguous in meaning. This is not due to 'truth' being somehow amorphous, but rather 
           the set of short people that I have in mind when I utter the statement is fuzzy.

           Fuzzy logic allows one to deal with such uncertainties and ambiguities in a definite mathematical way. One can
           define fuzzy sets such as "thirsty" and "some water" to make a fuzzy-based rule such as: "If I am thirsty,
           I will drink some water." The beauty of fuzzy logic is that the above fuzzy rule has a very definite a mathematical
           description under the hood.

           Indubitably, Zadeh wasn't the first to think of multi-valued logics. Philosophers such as Plato, Hegel, and others 
           had considered the notion of tri-valued logics. Lukasiewicz, in the early 20th century, placed three-valued logic
           on a more mathematical and rigorous foundation. Lukasiewicz also considered three, four, five, and infinite valued
           logics. G&#246del also considered mutli-valent logics. G&#246del's continuous-valued logic retained the conventions
           of Boolean logic in that the Law of Excluded Middle and the Law of Non-Contradiction were upheld. He did this by 
           handling the notions of set complement and implication in ways different from fuzzy logic.
