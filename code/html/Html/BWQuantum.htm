            At the end of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, physicists were faced with solving the 
            "Ultraviolet Catastrophe". This problem was so-named because at ultraviolet frequencies,
            classical theory and the emperica were in strong disagreement concerning black body 
            radiation. In fact, as the frequency became larger, the discrepancy between predicted
            energy and actual energy became much larger. 
         </p>
         <p>
            Black body radiation is energy in the form of radiation that is emitted from a perfect
            absorber. An easy way to create a black body is to drill a small hole in the side of 
            an oven. In this way, very little energy is absorbed from outside the oven, while most
            of the energy impinging on the hole will escape to the outside, i.e., the energy is
            emitted. The descrepancy between theory and experiment was considered a catastrophe 
            because it showed that something was inherently wrong with the equations of classical 
            thermodynamic theory.

            Classical mechanics assumed the atoms to be vibrating in the cavity of the oven thus emitting 
            electro-magnetic waves. From Maxwell's theory of electro-magnetism, one could calculate
            the number of 'standing wave' frequencies 
            (N(<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">n</span></span>)d<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">n</span></span>) 
            between the frequencies <span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">n</span></span> and 
            <span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">n</span></span> + d<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">n</span></span>.
            Essentially, this is the number of oscillators, or particles, in the cavity vibrating within
            the frequency range <span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">n</span></span> to 
            <span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">n</span></span> + 
            d<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">n</span></span>. Now, if 
            N(<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">n</span></span>)d<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">n</span></span> 
            is multiplied by the average energy of
            an oscillator, an expression for the energy emitted by the black body within the range
            <span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">n</span></span> to <span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">n</span></span> + 
            d<span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">n</span></span> will be obtained.
         </p>
         <p>
            To compute the average energy of a particle, an integral of probability-weighted energy is
            evaluated over all energies (a continuum of energies). The probability function is assumed
            to be a normalized Gaussian distribution function. When evaluated, this integral turns out
            to be kT, where k is Boltman's constant and T is the temperature of the cavity.
