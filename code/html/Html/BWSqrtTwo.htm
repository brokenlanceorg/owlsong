         <span class=bodyGreenSmallJustify>Proposition:</span> The square root of two is an irrational number.
         </p>
         <p>
         Before a proof is given, the proposition must be explained. Consider the natural numbers: 
         {1, 2, 3, ... } add to this set of numbers the set of negative numbers plus the number zero. This new set: 
         { ..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ... } is the set of Integers. Clearly, the integers is an infinite set of numbers. 
         Even though this is an infinite set of numbers it can be seen that this set
         needs to be enlarged to contain the numbers <i>between</i> successive whole numbers. These new additions are numbers such as &#188, &#189,
         &#190, ..., numbers that we use everyday in commerce, time keeping, measuring distance, etc. These numbers are called 
         rational because they are formed by taking the ratio of two whole numbers, thus the form of these numbers is: a / b, where a and b 
         are integers. Define the set of rational numbers as the integers taken together with all of the rational numbers.
         <p>
         The obvious question is: "does the set of rational numbers contain all possible numbers?" This question is answered by this proof. This
         proof shows that there are in fact numbers that are not contained in the set of rational numbers. These numbers are called <i>irrational
         numbers</i> because they can not be formed by making a ratio of two whole numbers.	
         </p>
         <p>
         To rigorously prove the proposition, we need to prove a minor lemma (a lemma is a theorem in its own right but is used in the proof of
         a larger theorem).
         </p>
         <p>
         <span class=bodyGreenSmallJustify>Lemma 1:</span> The square of an even number is an even number, and the square of an odd number is an
         odd number.
         </p>
         <p>
         <span class=bodyGreenSmallJustify>Proof of Lemma 1:</span> To begin, observe that an even number n is defined as n = 2k for some integer k. 
         That is, if n is even, there is some number k such that two times that number k gives the number n. Similarly, the definition of an odd 
         number m is m = 2k + 1 for some integer k. As in the statement of the lemma, take the square of an even number n: n&#178 = n * n = 2k * 2k = 4k&#178 
         for some integer k. The result is 4k&#178, another way of writing this is: 2*2k&#178, now let m = 2k&#178 and we have: n&#178 = 2m, 
         where m is some integer. Therefore, the square of an even number (n&#178) is also an even number (2m). 
         Now to prove the second half of the lemma: let n be an odd number then since n = 2k + 1 for some integer k, we have: 
         n&#178 = (2k + 1)&#178 = (2k + 1)(2k + 1) = 4k&#178 + 4k + 1 Now, factor out a 2 from the first two terms on the right hand side to get:
         2(2k&#178 + 2k) + 1, and let m = 2k&#178 + 2k, then n&#178 = 2m + 1, where m is an integer. Therefore, when n is odd, n&#178 is odd.

         With the lemma proved, the original proposition can be proved.
         </p>
         <p>
         <span class=bodyGreenSmallJustify>Proof:</span> First, we introduce some notation. Since the square root of a number times itself 
         gives back the number, denote the square root of n by: <span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#214</span></span>n because 
         <span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#214</span></span>n * <span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#214</span></span>n = n. 
         Suppose that our proposition is false, that is, the square root of 2 is a rational number so that: 
         n / m = <span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#214</span></span>2, and that n / m is 
         expressed in lowest terms, i.e., n and m share no common term. For example, suppose n = 5 and m = 10, then n / m can be 
         expressed in lowest terms by factoring out the 5 in both the numerator and the denomenator and then we are left with 1 / 2. 
         Looking again at n / m = <span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">&#214</span></span>2, with n / m expressed
         in lowest terms, take the square of both sides: (n / m)&#178 = n&#178 / m&#178 = 2 now multiply by m&#178 to get: n&#178 = 2m&#178 
         Thus, we see that n&#178 is an even number, and furthermore, by lemma 1, n must be even so that n = 2k for some integer k. 
         Substitute 2k for n back into n&#178 = 2m&#178 to get: (2k)&#178 = 4k&#178 = 2m&#178 dividing through by 2 yields: 2k&#178 = m&#178 
         Thus, m&#178 is even and by lemma 1, m must also be even. At this point, we have shown that <i>both</i> n and m are even, but n and m 
         were expressed in lowest terms so that they do not share a common term such as 2. Therefore, our only assumption in this proof 
         (that the square root of two equals a rational expression n / m) is false, and thus the square root of two is an irrational number.
         </p>
         <p>
         This existence proof demonstrates through <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> that the square root of two is an irrational number, or more generally, that
         the class of rationals does not constitute all of the numbers that we see in the world around us. A natural question that should be
         looming in one's head is: "does the set of irrationals constitute all of the numbers?" The answer to this question is 'no'. 
         </p>
         <p>
         The set of irrationals contains a subset known as the algebraic numbers. An example is the square root of two since it is the solution to the 
         following algebraic equation with integer coefficients: x&#178 - 2 = 0. The imaginary number i which is defined as i&#178 = -1 is the 
         solution to the algebraic equation: x&#178 + 1 = 0. All of the irrationals, and hence the rationals, integers, and naturals, can be 
         defined as the solution to an algebraic equation with integer coefficients. There are, however, numbers that are not solutions to 
         algebraic equations; these numbers are called <i>transcendental numbers</i>. Examples of this class of numbers are 
         <span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">p</span></span> = 3.14159... and e = 2.71828... or 
         <span class="symbol1"><span class="symbol2">p</span></span><sup>e</sup>, etc.
