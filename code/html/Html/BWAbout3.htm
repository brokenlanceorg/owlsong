         This notion of meaningful grammar naturally led to computers and computer code. I wrote my first computer program in BASIC on an Apple IIc; 
         I knew at that point that I wanted to be a computer programmer. Some of my fondest memories of childhood are playing dungeons and dragons 
         in a darkened room on a Commodore 64 while listening to Zeppelin. It is obvious that computers are going to become an <I>integral</I> part of 
         humans' lives in the near future.<br><br>

         Shortly after I left the ‘Christian’ school, I read Will Durant’s “The Story of Philosophy”. My worldview was opened to such an extent 
         that I felt I had been living in Plato’s cave. When I came to know Spinoza, I thought it was a matter of time before everything, 
         including metaphysics, would fall to the command of rational thought. Spinoza seemed to display a sense of rigor most philosophers and 
         theologians lacked. It is as Durant said: <I>”Spinoza is not to be read he is to be studied; you must approach him as you would approach 
         Euclid, recognizing that in these brief two hundred pages a man has written down his lifetime’s thought with stoic sculptory of everything 
         superfluous. Do not think to find it’s core by running over it rapidly…”</I> For a fifteen year old, this kind of rigor seemed to be the 
         sure sign of certainty. While I enjoyed the rigor afforded by an axiomatic approach, I still held the mathematicians in contempt because 
         I believed mathematics to be largely human-made, and arbitrary.<br><br>

         I continued to read as many philosophical treatises as I could get my hands on. Then one day, while reading a Carl Jung work 
         (I can’t recall exactly where now), Jung mentioned that the French mathematician Charles Hermite held that numbers exist in and of themselves. 
         I thought about this for a second, and it blew my mind! It then occurred to me that maybe mathematicians weren’t actually inventing 
         mathematics but rather <I>discovering</I> mathematics. I jumped into mathematics headfirst and I haven’t looked back since. 
         Indeed, I consider myself of the ‘Platonist’ school, that is, the belief that mathematics exists ‘out there’ as an objective reality 
         that we as humans perceive through rational thought. Thus, mathematical entities can be viewed by everyone (as theorems) and further 
         that they can be viewed by different angles (as theorems in seemingly disparate fields).<br><br>

         Behind my friend Varner’s house, a huge storage facility was built to store all of the chicken meat being produced by the nearby chicken plants. 
         In the process of building this factory, a mound of useless debris and dirt was compiled. This pile of dirt proved a perfect place to conduct 
         philosophical and theological discussions: to everyone except us, this pile of dirt was useless and abject. However, to
