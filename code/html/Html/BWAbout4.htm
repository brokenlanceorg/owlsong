         <a href="BWWe.htm" target="Main"><span class=linkTextWhite>We</span></a> had broken the bonds of Plato’s cave and 
         ascended to the <a href="BWMountain.htm" target="Main"><span class=linkTextWhite>mountaintop</span></a> where the sun 
         shines the brightest and one can see the farthest. 
         In honor of Tolkien, we christened the dirt pile ‘The Shire’ (actually a more appropriate name would have been ‘Hobbiton’, 
         but ‘The Shire’ seemed more euphonic).<br><br>

         The rednecks at the chicken factory decided that we were having too good of a time atop the dirt/debris pile, and further that they could 
         have a better time than us by riding their motorcycles on it. The management of the factory forced us to retire from the Shire. I vowed that  
         someday I would restore the spirit of the Shire, a spirit of learning and education.<br><br>

         It has been over a decade now, and our dream of restoring the Shire has been in a state of abeyance. Varner, Conduf, and I have moved to 
         distant states and inevitably our pursuits have taken us down differing paths. How to restore the Shire in this situation? 
         What is needed is a mechanism that can connect distant points as if those points exist in the same or nearby location. 
         The answer is the Internet. What can be done is a creation of a <I>virtual</I> Shire replete with silken scenes and heady thoughts.  
         A virtual Shire existing in the abstract aether of the World Wide Web that asks only one thing of its visitors: come with a mind ready 
         to employ the innate logic that is possessed by every sentient being. Enter the Abstract Shire.
