<p>
The erstwhile often-touted Melting Pot Theory of American homogenization 
has been discarded by many today. But in the 1950s the Melting Pot Theory 
was popular and influenced public policy toward Native Americans. 
The Termination Era was how the Melting Pot theory was given force through 
legislation that ended the legal existence that many sovereign nation-tribes had enjoyed since time immemorial. 
</p>

<p>
Under President Nixon, the concept that tribes should lose their collective 
identity and enter the American mainstream was formally discarded. 
Today, many tribal members marry outside their tribe, often with Anglo-Americans. 
Many Indians also marry other Indians of other tribes. 
Increasingly, there is a mixing, resulting in many intertribal children who may 
not belong to any tribe at all though these children are 100% Indian by blood quantum.
</P>

<P>
In this symbolic painting, a Taos Pueblo father is at the Indian Fair with what 
appear to be a Hopi wife and a young Navajo son. Behind the father is a 
sign advertising a strong man framed in "red," the color of his race. 
The little boy is cared for by his mother while he looks toward his father and the sign.  
</P>

<P>
The family stands by as their daughter, perhaps of an Anglo-Indian mix and 
in modern clothes, is carried away on a white horse with a blonde mane on a 
modern merry-go-round. Behind her a red horse shadows the white; 
where she sits she will never be far from the red horse &mdash;  it will 
shadow her as long as the ride lasts. Inheritance cannot be avoided.
</P>

<P>
The merry-go-round has at its center the axis with spokes radiating from 
that center point. Below and under the merry-go-round an abyss looms of 
unknown gadgetry that sets the wheel in motion, up or down, always the 
same motion and the same locations but with different passengers. 
The merry-go-round may be a dissonant echo of the Sundance, with its emphasis of returning and centering. 
</P>

<P>
In the distance are the familiar scenes of a fairground &mdash;  gaudy colors, 
misleading mirrors and flashing lights that glisten and beckon but offer 
little that is actually real or splendid. A white man sells cotton candy 
to an Indian woman &mdash;  a sickly sweetness that pleases but does not nourish. 
The fair reflects the materialism that surrounds the modern American family of any type. 
</P>

<P>
The beauty within this frame is not the fair but the family that, in whatever form, 
color or culture, continues to exist, circle after circle. 
The necessity of a strong family is of particular importance as all 
Americans increasingly suffer from and, one hopes, sense the falsity and 
senselessness of materialism and "pop culture." One senses an urge to 
return to a second kind of innocence that comes after childhood and after conquest &mdash;  
a voluntary returning to the sacred center of life, God-centered and family-centered. 
</P>

<P>
Neither the melting pot of genetics nor foreign threats are the great 
dangers to Tribal Americans and other Americans &mdash;  but rather materialism, 
consumerism and unfettered individualism are the real dangers that, acquiesced to, 
will digest the individual and render him faceless, empty and somehow less human. 
The merry-go-round may symbolize the faith that Indians have that family and nation 
will continue despite appearances to the contrary.
