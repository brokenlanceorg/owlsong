Feeling bad on the way to Carnegie &mdash; because it felt wrong to her. 
He said, "let's go to town" after they got the lease money. 
Lease money for rented allotment land that they got yesterday. 
So, it's time to celebrate &mdash; to eat and to drink. 
She feels a chill sitting in his new glossy-black car. 
He is always so quick to feel happy &mdash;  over nothing much &mdash;  like a little fool-boy (Malbane Tahlee). 
He thinks warm thoughts of drink and good food, and good times. 
She used to be his good times girl. Now she is quiet &mdash;  why does she have to be selfish? 
&mdash;  and make him feel bad because she, stubbornly, won't be happy and laugh like she used to on trips to Carnegie. 
</p>

<p>
She thinks, what is this unnamed feeling &mdash;  this feeling that I feel even toward this man I have known so long? 
That uncertainty that makes family and friend feel like strangers. 
Am I awful to feel that way toward them?... Or is it fear?  
This trip would be okay tomorrow; it would have been okay yesterday &mdash;  but not today.  
Something bad will happen tonight &mdash;  how come he never knows these things? Like the time his sister died
</P>

<P>
She thinks, "Usually you feel really bad after the event &mdash;  and for a long time after. 
Sometimes, rarely, you feel that really bad feeling while it's happening before you. 
Sometimes you feel that bad feeling before it happens because something tells 
you it waits for you around the corner." The car bends left toward Carnegie, accelerating. 
"The bad thing about knowing is not being able to say anything, the trick 
is just to get through it as fast as you can through the dark, watching out for the both of us." 
</P>

<P>
He stops talking because she isn't talking. She sits thinking while watching 
the star-beaded Oklahoma sky floating above, the twisted post oaks hurrying by; 
a coyote in the distance cackles long his crazy laugh. 
And looking out across the distance the dark car seems (to her) to 
gallop through the darkness, driving itself. Zeidl Bei (Terrible).
