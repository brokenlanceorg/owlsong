STrive to preserve the transition to improve .....



"Through my art, I endeavor to capture the struggle of the Kiowa people in their effort to adapt and ameliorate their culture to that of the New World Order." Jay Benham

In Jay's work, vivid colors and bold strokes summon the tableau of the Kiowa caught in the maelstrom of culture clash: a nation striving to honor the ancient and deeply-held traditions while progressing their social standing in the new economical and industrial revolution of the modern era.

Jay earned his BSE in Art Education from Henderson State University and his MA in Art Education from Northern Arizona University.

Jay's has displayed his art at the Red Earth Festival in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and the Santa Fe Art Market, Sante Fe, New Mexico.

Currently, Jay's work is showcased at the Oklahoma Indian Art Gallery in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, Vagabond Gallery in Sedona, Arizona, and at the First Peoples Gallery, Frisco, Colorado; his work can also be seen at the Fred Jones Museum of Modern Art, Norman, Oklahoma.

The Oklahoma Indian Art Gallery featured Jay's work in a distinguished one-man show in December of 2005.

By sharing his memories, dreams, and reflections of his Kiowa heritage, Jay hopes to chronicle some of the Kiowa's cultural transformation.

As a child I loved to draw.  I would draw on any surface.  From any type of paper to discarded wood and sheetrock.  I also enjoyed color as a child.  One of my earliest remembrances as a child was the many different colors of the cars on the kiddy car ride at the American Indian Exposition  ((Indian  Fair) in Anadarko, Oklahoma.  All the cars were shaped the same but each one was a different color.  To this day I can see the bright beautiful colors. We camped each year at the Indian Fair.  One year when I was about 10 years old my mother and I were walking through one of the exhibition buildings.  My mother said, "There's Al!"  It was Al Mamaday, my mother's cousin.  Al was a famous Kiowa Indian Artist and art teacher on the reservation in New Mexico.  He and my mother visited for a while, then he gave my mother one of his prints.  I was an impressed young man.  The very idea that you could make art and teach art as an adult.  At that time the seeds of art were sown in the young boy.The creative genes runs deep in the Kiowa family.  From Silverhorn though the Kiowa Five the need to draw, paint, and create and tell the Kiowa story is a driving force.Another influence I nave never revealed until now , is that of my Aunt Amy.  Amy (Bear) Tonamah was dying of cancer in 1953. She had viewed my early adolescent art work and was most encouraging.  She had me promise to pursue art to its fullest.Growing up in Arkansas there was not much understanding why a young man would be interested in art.  What's wrong with him?. I played football in high school and was fortunate to be awarded Arkansas All-State Honors and Honorable Mention All-American for the Sporting News Magazine.  I was never graduated from high school but was awarded a college football scholarship.  I accepted the scholarship and majored in Art Education.  I received my B.S.E. from Henderson State University and also earned a MA in Art Education from Northern Arizona University.I strive to tell the Kiowas story of their transition from their nomadic existence through the imposition of the Dawes Act when they became successful farmers in the modern society.It is my intention to make the best art that I know how.  Including all the elements of a good painting.  Applying good Kiowa color and interesting placement of the subject matter.  When I am painting there is a mystic and close relationship to God.  During the creative experience of painting, time stops.  I've always thought that everybody aught to be in some type of creative process, no matter the medium.  It's my hope that all individuals could express the closeness to the source of all power. No matter what you call the source of power.  I call it God.
